qkg6mn	How do people get money from Crypto and what does burning mean? Also - how the hell did people invest in Bitcoin back in the day?	Burning is when you put enough energy into a material and it starts combusting with the oxygen around it emitting radiation. <br />Example : when you light a piece of paper it starts *burning*	Burning is when you send a crypto token to a wallet that does not have an access key. Without the key, no one can access the token and is lost. It's like burning money.	HHh[4][-12]
r26cf5	What are toll roads or "turnpikes" used for? Where does the money collected by toll roads go and what is it used for exactly, entering a new country is understanderble but they have toll roads on highways where there is no border so what is the purpose of these stops which take unnecessary fees??	There is a toll road near my house. It was built by a private company on private land. It represents a significant short-cut between two state-built roads. The company built the road, and collects tolls for its use, in an effort to make money.<br />So, in this case, the toll goes to repay the initial investment to acquire the land and build the road. It also goes toward providing snow removal, maintenance, and repair.	The money from the tolls usually goes towards maintaining the road, and/or is like a travel tax that the state can use for other projects. Sometimes tolls are only there to cover the cost of constructing the road and then once it's paid off they take the toll off (that's less common though).	HHh[6][2]
ro7rd6	HOW does a Crypto coin's value go below its starting price? 	Money of any kind has no intrinsic value. There’s no purpose for it except to be exchanged for something else<br />Therefore the value is based on how much exchange you believe you can do with it. So the value of it is just a measure of how much a group of people believe it is worth	There is no starting price. Cryptocurrency is worth what people that are willing to purchase it think it is worth.  There is no intrinsic value in cryptocurency.	HHh[20][0]
rcio7s	Why do we even have a debt ceiling if we just raise it every time we get close? 	If you want the US govt to go into default and not pay its bills then don’t raise debt ceiling. If you want govt to continue paying its obligations then vote for it. Clinton was last potus to balance a budget and Nixon was last gop potus to balance a budget. Congress and every other potus is responsible for our debt.	The debt ceiling is a limit on how much money the federal government can borrow. It was put in place to help control government spending. Every time the government reaches the debt ceiling, Congress has to vote to raise it. Some people think that the debt ceiling is unnecessary and that we should just get rid of it.	HMH[8]
pkk600	How devaluing your currency increases exports. 	You're Germany and exporting BMW's. A €40k car costs $50k in the US because a Euro is worth $1.25.<br />Euro is devalued so that €1 is $1. Now, that same €40K BMW only costs $40k in the US. Demand for a $40k BMW will be higher than the demand for the same car if it costs $50k. So there will be more demand for BMW exports. German workers still make same wages, (European) suppliers still get same money for parts, etc. but the factory will need to crank out more cars to keep up with increased demand.	Devaluing your currency makes your exports cheaper relative to other countries' exports. This increases demand for your exports, and can help your country's trade balance.	HMH[5]
r0ky8c	There is all this talk about global USD shortage despite trillions that were printed in the last 2 years, what gives? 	If you go back in time prior to 1990 most of the world's debt is denominated in the local currency of the country where the debt was made.  So if I'm an Indian oil refiner and I want to get a loan to build a new plant, I go to a bank and get a loan that I have to pay back in Indian Rupees.  Similarly, if I'm the government of Vietnam and I want to get a loan to build a new highway, I'll go to a bank and get a loan that needs to be paid back in Vietnamese Dong (no they're not cutting people's penises off, that's what the currency there is called).<br />The problem with this is that most of the loans that are being made to countries outside of the US/EU/Japan are being made by the US/EU/Japan.  Countries outside of that area are also incredibly corrupt.  So what happens when the Vietnamese government can't afford to pay back its loan?  It prints a shitload of Dong and uses the freshly printed currency to pay off its debt.  Because of how many Dong have been printed to satisfy this debt, the value of the Dong collapses and the lender is left with a pile of worthless currency.<br />The solution that lenders in the US/EU/Japan came up with for this problem was to make it so that borrowers outside of those regions have to pay back their loans in dollars.  Now it doesn't matter how much the Vietnamese government devalues its currency - it still has to pay back the same amount of dollars.  <br />Most corporate/national debt is made in the form of 20 or 30 year bonds.  In a 20 year bond you make a small interest payment each year.  Then, at the end of the 20 years, you pay back *the entirety of what you were initially loaned*.  <br />So imagine you take a $100 loan, paid back over 20 years with an interest rate of 1%.  Each year you pay the lender $1 (1% of $100).  Then on year 20 you pay $101 (the original $100 value of the loan plus your final interest payment).  That means that to make your debt payment for year 20, you need 101 times as many dollars as you did to make your payment in year 19.<br />Right now all of the early dollar denominated loans to the third world are starting the hit that point where the borrowers need to make that big, final payment.  That's causing a sudden surge in the need for companies and governments to get dollars.  <br />You can view the China Evergrande situation as being a direct result of this.  Evergrande needs to make the final payment on a lot of its 20/30 year bonds right now.  It has physical assets with a sufficient value to do this (it owns a lot of land and buildings).  The problem is it can't hand the buildings to its creditors because of Chinese government restrictions on foreign land ownership.  It needs to sell the buildings to get dollars to pay off its loans.  But it needs so many dollars so quickly that its hard to find people that have that many dollars at once.	There are a few different factors at play here. First, the US dollar is still considered the global reserve currency, meaning that it is used more than any other currency for international transactions. This means that demand for dollars is always high, even when there is a lot of them in circulation.<br /><br />Second, the trillions of dollars that were printed in the last two years were mostly used to bail out banks and other financial institutions. This money never actually made it into the hands of consumers, so it didn't really increase the overall money supply.<br /><br />Lastly, the global economy is still recovering from the last recession, and many countries are still dealing with high levels of debt. This means that there is less demand for USD-denominated assets, and that the dollar is under more pressure than it has been in recent years.	HMH[70]
r025xx	How do credit/debit cards work? What is the process of putting money in and getting it out? 	A credit or debit card is basically just an easy way to allow a shop to speak to your bank.<br />First you go into the bank, and you either deposit some cash into your account (debit), or you ask the bank nicely to cover you, and promise that you will pay them back at the end of the month (credit).<br />Then you can go shopping. You get to the till with your products, which you now need to pay for, but instead of handing over cash directly, you ask the shop to deal directly with your bank. The shop phones up the bank and asks them to take X amount of money out of your account, then nip over to the shops own bank and give it to them on your behalf, which they do.<br />That is pretty much how a credit or debit card works, just automated with computers...	Debit cards are linked to a bank account and whenever you pay using a debit card, the amount is deducted from the bank account on completion of the transaction. So, instead of withdrawing and handing over cash for a purchase, you can swipe the card.<br />Credit cards come with a credit limit and a defined billing cycle (generally monthly). So, you can make purchases using the credit card upto the defined credit limit. The bill is generated as per the defined billing cycle and you are required to settle it just like the bills for any other utilities.<br />Hope this helps.	HHh[6][1]
r6imxp	Would burning money help with the inflation problem in Venezuela for example? 	No.<br />Paper money is a tiny fraction of the actual money.  Most money is just numbers in bank accounts.	Hyper inflation occurs when people, lenders, foreign companies e.t.c lose confidence in the currency. <br />If I'm a shop owner and I usually sell an apple for 1 coin. However I'm not convinced in a month I'll be able to buy myself enough food/pay rent e.t.c by selling apples for 1 coin. So I raise my prices today to protect myself against currency changes in the future. This of course spirals out of control because everyone starts doing this.<br />Because the value is changing fast, there is no point saving money, so everyone tries to spend all their money at once before it's value is rapidly eroded to zero. Often money will be spent the same day it is earned - and everyone spending every penny every day pushes up prices more and the cycle continues. <br />The only way to fix the issue is to make people trust the currency again. This is usually done by adopting a stable foreign currency or pegging your currency to a foreign currency. (Brazil effectively stopped hyperinflation).	HHH[3][1]
pe3pph	why do countries with a fiat currency still use tax? Considering that fiat money isn’t tied to anything tangible, it doesn’t seem to make sense having to tax? Is it that the only purpose of tax today is redistribution of wealth?	There are a few reasons why countries with a fiat currency still use tax. First, tax revenue is one of the main ways that governments fund public goods and services. Without tax revenue, governments would have to rely on other sources of funding, which might not be as stable or reliable. Second, tax helps to reduce income inequality by redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor. This is especially important in countries with a large income gap between the rich and the poor. Finally, tax can be used to discourage certain activities that are harmful to the economy or society, such as smoking or pollution.	How would governments pay for social services?	HMM[6]
pbpkt5	What is a mutual fund and how does it work? 	You’ll probably get a better answer, but basically someone invests all of the money paid in to it and you share all the gains and losses together. So you will almost always slowly grow over time. Probably pretty in line with what ever the overall market grew.	A mutual fund is like carpooling but for investments. <br />Instead of you buying and selling your individual shares of companies directly on the exchange, you buy "units" of the mutual fund. The managers of the fund (investment experts... usually... hopefully) pool all of the money from individual investors (you) and use it to buy/invest in the stocks. Any gains that the fund makes through regular "buy low,sell high" or dividends are split back to the individual fund investors (you) in proportion of units held. <br />The fund managers will charge a small amount for their "expertise" but otherwise just invest and manage according to the mutual fund's portfolio mandate. Like for example, some funds invest purely in R&D, others only in tech or wireless communication, others in green energy etc.	HHh[7][2]
ppipa7	How the tax rates are determined by governments? I would assume that governments estimate the amount of extra money they need to finance public healthcare, pensions, infrastructure improvements, etc. They make the projection for the coming years, add some safety gap on top and then calculate the tax rate based on this required amount of extra income. Is that true?<br />If so, such calculation leads us to a flat tax rate. If we are talking about a progressive tax, how are the decisions about tax bands and rates for each band made?	Governments use a variety of methods to determine tax rates. In some cases, rates are set based on the amount of money the government needs to raise to fund specific programs or initiatives. In other cases, tax rates may be based on a percentage of income, with higher earners paying a higher rate. Additionally, some governments use a progressive tax system, in which tax rates increase as income increases.	You'd be wrong.<br />The legislature gets input from economic calculations, in the US from the Congressional Budget Office, but more often than not the numbers are chosen to send political messages.<br />There are very, very few flat tax systems.  Almost all systems are extremely progressive, what's the point of collecting taxes from some poor person who you make social safety net payments to?  That would just be government using taxes to collect its own money.  Tax bands are set politically, trading off the influence of the rich with the influence of the anti-rich.  (poor ≠ anti-rich)  Poor people have little money; whereas anti-rich people don't want other people to have as much money as they already have.	HMM[6]
ovoa4e	I keep hearing that 20% of all US dollars were printed in the last year, so why isn’t the inflation rate 20%? 	Are they referring to actual printed money? If so, I’m sure quite a bit of currency was withdrawn from circulation, as well.	There are a few reasons why the inflation rate is not 20% despite the fact that 20% of all US dollars were printed in the last year. First, it takes time for new money to enter the economy and start circulating. Second, not all of the new money will end up being used to purchase goods and services; some of it may be saved or used to pay off debt, for example. Finally, the inflation rate is calculated using a basket of goods and services, so it may not reflect the impact of new money on the prices of specific goods and services.	HMH[8]
pjl7ly	With seemingly half of downtown Manhatten's commercial real estate being vacant, why do real estate agents prefer having a venue vacant over just lowering prices? I'm not a U.S. citizen, but the whole thing going on on [Louis Rossman's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpC4IGAkgok) (who runs the Right to Repair movement, but also makes video about the ridiculousness of New York real estate) intrigues me. <br />You see hundreds upon hundreds vacant stores 'for rent', while they still ask the same ridiculous prices (up to $55,000 a month for a store). Rossman has seen stores that have been vacant and for rent for literally over 5 years, while te price stays the same. <br />What do real estate brokers gain from this? Do they just hope that \*someone\* jumps the boat and deny that prices are too high? Enlighten me :)	a lot of it is investment for speculation. Rich people want to own and trade buildings like stocks, they don't want to be landlords or property owners. They plan to hold it for 10 years and sell it for 87 million dollars more than they bought it for and just would rather not deal with the hassle of doing a bunch of stuff to get 800 dollars a month in rent.	if you ask for a lower rent, then the valuation for your property drops since that is typically tied to the rent. obviously it should drop anyway, but that happens more slowly and especially if the building was bought on credit or the building itself is collateral for a credit, they sometimes cant afford to have the value drop.

r5l7bu	Why can't currencies change their value to be in line with other currencies? For example, Japanese Yen, Central African Francs and other currencies all have exchange rates to USD/GBP of decimal places. Why can't 1 CAF or JPY = 1 USD/GBP?	One of the main reasons why currencies can't change their value to be in line with other currencies is because of the different economic conditions in different countries. For example, Japan has a much stronger economy than the Central African Republic, so the Japanese Yen is worth more than the Central African Franc. If all currencies were worth the same, then it would be very difficult for people to trade goods and services between different countries.	They can, but that would require effort by someone. If, for example, someone wanted JPY to be equal to one USD they would have to buy lots and lots of JPY and pay for it with USD. And I mean LOTS.  <br />Central banks sometimes do this, for example the central bank of Denmark holds the Danisk Krone (DKK) at a fixed rate (not 1 to 1, but a still a fixed rate) relative to the Euro (EUR).<br />This is expensive, tedious, and there isn't really much point so almost nobody bothers with it. Denmark does it because they wanted to keep the DKK while still being part of the EU, and that was the compromise they reached.	HMM[3]
e658y	what exactly is money and why can’t we just print more i mean, we created it for currency because of the gold rush or something right??? why did we decide this was best and why can’t we just orint more money ??? what gives a paper bill the value ???	The concept of money is a human invention, not a natural occurrence. Money is an abstract idea that represents a unit of exchange. It is a tool that we use to buy and sell goods and services.<br /><br />The value of money is based on trust. People trust that money will retain its value over time, and that it can be used to purchase goods and services. Money is also a store of value, meaning it can be saved and used in the future.<br /><br />The supply of money is limited. Central banks can print more money, but this can cause inflation, which reduces the value of money. Money is also a scarce resource, which is why we use it as a unit of exchange.<br /><br />There are different types of money, including fiat money, commodity money, and cryptocurrency. Fiat money is money that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver. Commodity money is money that is backed by a physical commodity. Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography to secure its transactions.	The US uses a Fiat Currency and its value is derived from the supply and demand for it like anything else.<br />Governments can and do print money. Theoretically they could print money to pay for all government services, so why don't they?<br />The answer is inflation. The more money in circulation the less its overall value.<br />Ever see a loaf of bread go for $1000? You can, and you will!<br />Post WW2 German and several African nations are examples of extreme inflation, where the government kept printing money but it crippled its value. So while it helped in the short term to fix their problems, printing money eventually caused the money to be worth less than toilet paper.	HMM[7]
os3rak	. What stops a 1000 dollar check made out to cash from being used as a 1000 dollar bill. A bit confusing but what I mean by this is say, a guy writes a 1000 dollar check (made out to cash)to buy a quad. The guy receiving the check, instead of cashing it out, uses the original check to then go buy his own quad and so on.	Because checks are not legal tender. They are an IOU to be deposited from one account to another, and are therefore mere debit checks, hence the name. <br />You have to use legal tender provided by the Treasury as cash.	The risk of the check bouncing stops that. <br />Someone wants to pay you with cash?  Great - now you have cash!  <br />Someone wants to pay you with a check made out to cash, which was written on the account of some other third guy that you never heard of?  Riiiiiight - your immediate first thought is going to be "well that's *clearly* a scam of some kind", even if it really is legit.	HHh[5][0]
qbo6dz	How are countries in billions of dollars in debt? Who do they owe? I’ve never really understood this. Do all these countries borrow money from each other back and forth? Tf is going on?	Most debt is in the form of treasury bonds, which are essentially IOU's from the government in question. Basically, the government sells a bond to someone, and after a set amount of time that bond can be redeemed for it's face value, and with interest. The functional value of a bond is built entirely on the value of the government (or company) that backs the bond; if that government is perceived as stable, then the bond retains value, because there's a perception that the bond will be paid when it comes due.<br />In turn, bonds are an investment. They're, generally, slightly better than cash, entirely because bonds grow in face value over time, whereas cash does not.	Yes they do. Example is America borrowing from China. What happens is America issues bonds. When someone purchases a bond they are essentially lending there money for a specified amount of time. (In bond language it’s called a term). Once the term of the bond is fulfilled America conducts another bond offering (lending more money ) in order to pay down some of the debt with the proceeds it collects from a bond sale. It’s called rolling over the debt. It’s a continuous cycle that America will never get out of.	HHH[3][-2]
p174m6	Why do some countries measure their currencies in large units? For example in Vietnam, lunch can be bought for 50,000 VD and in South Korea, apartments can cost several MILLION Won. Why do some countries use such large denominations?	It is actually the inflation's side effect.<br />The money worth less than the paper they paint it on. So, they use a higher number.<br />You can see how it begins (again) in Turkish Lira. In 2007, Turkey removed 6 zeroes from the money (ie 10 million TLs become 10 TLs). The $/TL was something like 1.20.<br />Now, $/TL is 8.65. TL loses it's worth. <br />To somewhat counter that, countries issue higher bills. So that the minimum wages can keep up against the inflation and people can afford basic stuff like electricity bills and such.	There are a few reasons why some countries might choose to measure their currency in large units. One reason is that it can help to combat inflation. When prices are rising rapidly, it can be difficult to keep track of the value of goods and services if the currency is divided into small units. It can also be difficult to make change for small purchases. If the currency is measured in larger units, it can be easier for people to keep track of the value of goods and services and to make change. Another reason for using large units of currency is that it can make transactions more efficient. For example, if you are buying a car for $1,000, it is more efficient to pay in one $1,000 bill than to pay in ten $100 bills. Finally, large units of currency can also make it easier to track money laundering and other illicit financial activities. If all transactions are conducted in large units of currency, it can be easier to track the flow of money and to identify suspicious activity.	HMH[85]
q0sm2a	why do some currencies have an incredibly large number for such a small value of money? For example, 10,000 S.Korean Won is about £6.20.  So isn't it impractical that 1 won is a tiny fraction of a penny and basically has no value?	I’m guessing you’ve been watching “squid game” and googled the amount of money the players were set to earn at the end and throughout the series…😅 bcz I did the same if that’s the reason!	Two reasons. Their currency is based on the smallest unit so a Korean Won would be like a US penny. And because their currency has less value so you need more of it to reach an equivalent value of a stronger currency.	HHh[5][0]
pqfndb	Why can't Jeff Bezos or the top 5 richest simply end world hunger or homelessness? I've started to wonder this more and more. A guy like. Bezos could end hunger or give everyone who is homeless a place to start, but doesn't. Why is that? It seems so simple to do	There are a number of reasons why the world's richest people cannot simply end hunger or homelessness. First, hunger and homelessness are complex problems that require more than just financial resources to solve. Addressing hunger and homelessness requires a coordinated effort from governments, NGOs, and private individuals and organizations. Second, even if the world's richest people were to donate all of their wealth to ending hunger and homelessness, it would not be enough. The scale of the problem is simply too large. It is estimated that it would cost $30 billion per year to end hunger, and $20 billion per year to end homelessness. Third, the world's richest people are not all philanthropists. Some may be reluctant to donate their wealth to causes like ending hunger and homelessness, because they do not believe that these problems can be solved, or because they do not think it is their responsibility to solve them.	He doesn't have enough money, not nearly enough.<br />700M people live is World Bank "extreme poverty", less than $2 per day in total income.  This was 2B people in 1990.<br />To be only "poor" you need $48 per day in income.  That's $33.6B per day.  Jeff Bezos has $200B, so his entire fortune would be spent in 6 days.	HMM[8]
