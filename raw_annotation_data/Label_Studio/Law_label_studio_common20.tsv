owkgdn	why are the ones responsible for instigating the Jan 6th insurrection not in jail? 	Proving an allegation of that level of severity would require a lot of strong evidence; if you jail someone over it before you have that evidence ready, you risk utterly botching the investigation or subsequent court proceedings and having the person walk away on technicalities. Given the number of defendants charged/arrested/facing trial/convicted, it's likely quite a few of them have been/will add more information through interrogation/interview that will potentially build up evidence as well. When you're talking about 500+ defendants, it's going to take a while to sort through everything they say and corroborate/disprove things.<br />This applies especially when the people concerned are high-ranking public figures are involved, or wealthy citizens who can afford top notch legal support, and when a misstep could end up further fueling political violence/extremism.<br />Federal prosecutors in particular tend not to file charges/order an arrest until they are absolutely certain a conviction will occur.	for the same reason almost no one from the BLM riots are in jail, its politically damaging to jail "dissidents" and can easily be spun into a rally call by the opposition.

odbphm	Why was prohibition of alcohol part of the constitution when other things have been federally outlawed without an amendment? Is there a reason prohibition could not have been a series of laws passed rather than being ratified into the constitution?	Rule 2.<br />Better to r/askanamerican or r/ask_lawyers about this.	Back then they followed the Constitution’s federalism framework. The feds didn’t have the power to ban something throughout the country through law. It had to be an amendment. Since then they’ve taken far more power, so they can ban other things today.	HHh[8][1]
r6cc2d	Prison sentences that go way beyond an average lifespan. I'm talking 100-1000 year sentence 	Several reasons<br />It sends a signal as to how severe the crime is. The justice system is telling us that this person did stuff bad enough to be incarcerated for more than the rest of their life.<br />It helps the victims and survivors to see that the crime against them has been recognized. If you have a single "life" sentence for someone that killed four people, the families of those four people are just seeing it as a single crime. However, 25 years for each adding to a hundred years in total acknowledges them as four individual crimes. There's perhaps a little more comfort in that, and a sense of justice served.<br />And it helps make more informed decisions about the possibility of parole or clemency in the future. Dude got a life sentence? Maybe 20 years served is enough. Dude got a 1000 year sentence? They ain't EVER getting out.	This is mostly an issue in states where prison sentences can stack upon each other. 5 years for three robberies make 15 years in total. This is not done in many states as far as I am aware. <br />E.g. most states in the european union take all charges known into a single court trial and get a prison sentence out covering all charges into one. <br />Also many european countries have a max-lifetime sentence which cannot be extend under normal circumstances. E.g. in germany its 15 years IIRC. Which is a fairly significant span of your life.<br />Because longer prison sentences do not stop crime in large, nor do they help with the reintegration of criminals into society. Something most modern justice systems try to achieve. Instead they just cost money, lead to overcrowed prisons and offer little to no benefit for society at large.	HHH[5][0]
qpa4a6	Theoretically, is there any limitations to stem cell treatment? Is it just so badass that it can cure everything or is there limitations that I don’t know?	We don't know.  Currently it can't cure anything.  There is a lot of thinking that it can do this or that or fix this or that or whatever, but none of it has really panned out yet.  <br />They've been talking about stem cells fixing spinal cord injuries for as long as I can remember, but so far, no fix.	There are a few potential limitations to stem cell treatment. First, stem cells can sometimes be difficult to obtain. Second, stem cells may not be effective for all types of diseases or conditions. Third, there is a risk that the stem cells may not integrate properly into the body. Finally, there is a risk of side effects associated with stem cell treatment.	HMH[6]
oceu2p	Why do some defendants appear in court all dressed up while others appear in prison uniforms? Clearly, those wearing prison garb are going to get treated differently.	As a general rule, defendants are allowed to change into proper attire when they attend court dates for the exact reasons you have mentioned - the jumpsuit is likely to be prejudicial to a jury.<br />However, those clothes are not provided by the state.  If a defendant is unable to acquire suitable clothing, they will appear as they are.	Rule 2.<br />Better to check r/answers or r/ask_lawyers.	HHH[50][1]
qbt9gg	why cant america just ban guns feels like it would solve alot of problems	There are a number of reasons why America cannot simply ban guns. First, there is the issue of the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution. The Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to keep and bear arms. This right has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to apply to individuals, and not just to militias. As a result, any attempt to ban guns would likely be unconstitutional.<br /><br />Second, there is the issue of enforcement. Even if guns were banned, there would still be a black market for them. It would be very difficult to enforce a ban on guns, and there would likely be a lot of violence associated with the black market.<br /><br />Third, there is the issue of self-defense. Many people believe that they have a right to defend themselves and their families, and that banning guns would take away that right.<br /><br />Fourth, there is the issue of hunting. Hunting is a popular sport in America, and many people believe that banning guns would take away their ability to hunt.<br /><br />Finally, there is the issue of politics. The gun lobby is very powerful in America, and any attempt to ban guns would likely face a lot of opposition.	For the same reason you can’t ban free speech.  It is a constitutional freedom that was designed to be difficult dismantle.	HMM[6]
pisba0	Why criminals need to throwing away the guns after committing a serious crime 	The act of disposing of a weapon can be an attempt to distance oneself from a crime.  If the police see that someone was killed with a specific type of handgun, and then through their investigation, they discover that you have that handgun in your possession, it's a huge help towards solving the crime and prosecuting the criminal.  Disposing of the weapon could provide a means of deniability if the weapon is found, for example a criminal may say "Oh someone stole that gun from me a month ago and I haven't seen it since."  Plausible defense if the gun is found in a lakebed, not so much if it's found in your sock drawer.	There are a few reasons why criminals might choose to get rid of their guns after committing a serious crime. One reason is that it could help them avoid getting caught by the police. If the police find the gun at the crime scene, they could use it to trace the gun back to the owner and then to the criminal. Another reason is that it could help the criminal avoid getting caught with the gun in their possession. If the police stop the criminal and find the gun, they could arrest the criminal for possession of a firearm.	HMH[4]
pctia1	How can the Texas House Speaker ban the word “racism” from being used in a legislative session? Can he restrict the free speech of Texas’ House Members? Is this legal?	The Texas House Speaker can ban the word "racism" from being used in a legislative session by issuing a formal directive to House Members. This directive could state that the use of the word "racism" is prohibited in any official capacity during the session. House Members would then be required to adhere to this directive or face consequences, such as being removed from the session or being censured.<br /><br />The Speaker's ability to restrict the free speech of House Members is derived from the House's rules of order. These rules give the Speaker significant authority to regulate the conduct of Members and to enforce decorum in the chamber. While the Speaker's authority is not absolute, it is generally upheld by the House as long as the Speaker is acting in good faith and in the interest of maintaining order.<br /><br />The legality of the Speaker's actions would likely be challenged on the grounds that they violate the First Amendment right to free speech. However, the Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment does not protect all forms of speech, and that the government can place reasonable restrictions on speech in certain circumstances. It is possible that a court would find that the Speaker's actions are permissible under the First Amendment, although this is by no means certain.	Technically the floor of a congress is NOT a place with full freedom of speech. There is a system called "parliamentary rules" that dictates who can speak when and, often, what they are allowed to speak about. These rules are a little different for every lawmaking body, but there are some common ideas.<br />The House Speaker in Texas is able to set parliamentary rules so long as procedures are followed. That can include defining what counts as acceptable speech. The procedures to change the rules might require a vote, but if the vote passes then that's that.	HMM[8]
p44ew1	Why are sex offenders registered in the national registry, but other serious crimes like robbery and murder is not? 	it's mainly a political agenda to "protect the kids"  because kids being sexually abused is worse than kids being murdered.	Some sex offenders are very likely to reoffend. We should keep those folks locked up, but instead we decided to let them out (rape and sexual assault sentencing guidelines are ridiculously light).<br />Instead of increasing sentences, we decided to let these dangerous folks out, lump them together with less dangerous people guilty of things like indecent exposure while intoxicated, and put them on a list that prevents them from rejoining society in a meaningful way.<br />We should not have this list. Many of the people on it should still be in prison. Let out nonviolent drug felons to make room.	HHh[5][-1]
ok4stv	What is a filibuster? I keep hearing about it but I truly don’t understand what it means and why it’s such a big deal?	A filibuster is a parliamentary procedure where debate on a bill is extended, essentially preventing a vote from taking place. This can be done by any senator, and in the past, it was used as a way to stall civil rights legislation. Nowadays, it's often used as a tactic to delay or prevent a vote on a bill, or to force the Senate to reach a 60-vote supermajority.	Originally, senators debated bills or confirmations. A senator can speak as long as he wants in this debate, and in the past they spoke for days to delay a bill, even reading from a phone book to pass the time. That's a filibuster. The rest of the Senate can shut him up with 60 votes to allow debate to continue (cloture). The Senate could only consider one bill at a time, so this held up the entire work of the Senate, even stopped the people of the same party from getting their bills heard. Filibusters were very politically expensive and individually exhausting, so they didn't happen much. <br />Over the years this has evolved. Back in the 1970s the Democrats allowed two legislative tracks, making it less politically expensive. The number of filibusters shot up after that. It eventually involved into not having to actually speak, and now any senator can stall a bill simply by saying so. Filibusters are now politically cheap, so they happen all the time, any bill or confirmation that is in any way contentious.	HMM[3]
rkogo2	What is “age of consent” Just saw an advice post about a 16 y/o worried about dating an 18 y/o boy she likes. Seems like that’d be the definition of “consent”, yet many people in the thread were concerned about legality.	In the context of relationships and dating, the age of consent refers to the minimum age at which one person is legally allowed to engage in sexual activity with another person. In most jurisdictions, the age of consent is 16 years old, which means that anyone under the age of 16 is not legally allowed to consent to sexual activity. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule, such as if the two people areClose in age (e.g. within 3 years of each other) or if they are married.<br /><br />In the case of the 16 year old girl and the 18 year old boy, the age of consent would be 18 years old. This means that the 16 year old girl is not legally allowed to consent to sexual activity with the 18 year old boy. However, as long as the 18 year old boy is not more than 3 years older than the 16 year old girl, the two of them can still date and engage in sexual activity without breaking any laws.	The age of consent is a legal term for the minimum age in which a person can consent to sexual activity. In a sense it sets a standard in which a person cannot agree to sex before a certain age. Then sex, even with a willing participant becomes sexual assault by default or statute.	HMM[9]
olnx1f	What's the difference between decriminalization and legalization? 	Decriminalization is the process of removing criminal penalties for a particular activity, while legalization is the process of making that activity legal. For example, decriminalization of marijuana would mean that possessing small amounts of the drug would no longer be a criminal offense, while legalization would mean that marijuana would be regulated and taxed like any other product.	In practise, the difference is that you won't be arrested for the offence along (eg possession of decriminalised drugs) but if you're being arrested for something else, like assault/robbery etc they'll charge you with possession as part of that arrest. Basically, it makes it defacto legal, so long as you're not engaged in other criminal activity	HMM[5]
orpajp	How a bill gets introduced to the U.S. Congress Just curious about this.	First you have to be a member of Congress, either a representative or a senator. Then you have secret meetings with lobbyists and wealthy donors to your campaign. These people are often hired or bribed by companies who want the law to be changed to help them make more money, or by "think tanks", which is are secret businesses devoted to influencing politicians and public opinion. At the meeting, you will learn what goals and agenda they want you to pursue, and what aspects of current law they are unhappy with.<br />The lobbyists or think tank will have lawyers on hand, who will secretly write up a bill for you, which contains the desired changes to the law. The bill will have your name on it, as if you're the author. But you can't write it yourself, because getting elected to this law-writing, law-debating office did not require you to actually know anything about law; it was part popularity contest, part referendum on whatever issues you successfully dumbed down to be a choice good & evil.<br />\[obviously, a cynical take...\]	Boy: Woof! You sure gotta climb a lot of steps to get to this Capitol Building here in Washington. But I wonder who that sad little scrap of paper is?<br />I’m just a bill.<br />Yes, I’m only a bill.<br />And I’m sitting here on Capitol Hill.<br />Well, it’s a long, long journey<br />To the capital city.<br />It’s a long, long wait<br />While I’m sitting in committee,<br />But I know I’ll be a law someday<br />At least I hope and pray that I will,<br />But today I am still just a bill.<br />Boy: Gee, Bill, you certainly have a lot of patience and courage.<br />Bill: Well I got this far. When I started, I wasn’t even a bill, I was just an idea. Some folks back home decided they wanted a law passed, so they called their local Congressman and he said, “You’re right, there oughta be a law.” Then he sat down and wrote me out and introduced me to Congress. And I became a bill, and I’ll remain a bill until they decide to make me a law.<br />I’m just a bill<br />Yes I’m only a bill,<br />And I got as far as Capitol Hill.<br />Well, now I’m stuck in committee<br />And I’ll sit here and wait<br />While a few key Congressmen discuss and debate<br />Whether they should let me be a law.<br />How I hope and pray that they will,<br />But today I am still just a bill.<br />Boy: Listen to those congressmen arguing! Is all that discussion and debate about you?<br />Bill: Yeah, I’m one of the lucky ones. Most bills never even get this far. I hope they decide to report on me favourably, otherwise I may die.<br />Boy: Die?<br />Bill: Yeah, die in committee. Oooh, but it looks like I’m gonna live! Now I go to the House of Representatives, and they vote on me.<br />Boy: If they vote yes, what happens?<br />Bill: Then I go to the Senate and the whole thing starts all over again.<br />Boy: Oh no!<br />Bill: Oh yes!<br />I’m just a bill<br />Yes, I’m only a bill<br />And if they vote for me on Capitol Hill<br />Well, then I’m off to the White House<br />Where I’ll wait in a line<br />With a lot of other bills<br />For the president to sign<br />And if he signs me, then I’ll be a law.<br />How I hope and pray that he will,<br />But today I am still just a bill.<br />Boy: You mean even if the whole Congress says you should be a law, the president can still say no?<br />Bill: Yes, that’s called a veto. If the President vetoes me, I have to go back to Congress and they vote on me again, and by that time you’re so old…<br />Boy: By that time it’s very unlikely that you’ll become a law. It’s not easy to become a law, is it?<br />Bill: No!<br />But how I hope and I pray that I will,<br />But today I am still just a bill.<br />Congressman: He signed you, Bill! Now you’re a law!<br />Bill: Oh yes!!!	HHh[32][1]
p0m3iw	why do we need to abide the law? From when does a human need to abide the law, who've set the first laws, who decided that every human needs to respect it? so many questions, so few answers	Laws are enforced by the government and police force. In the past, laws would have been enforced formally or informally by other members of your community.<br />If I get together with a bunch of people, we could all decide that stealing is wrong. We could then agree on a punishment for stealing. If someone tries to steal, the rest of the society would band together to enforce this punishment. I'm incentivized to not steal because the consequences of stealing are worse than the benefits I'd gain.	There are a number of reasons why we need to abide by the law. First and foremost, the law is designed to protect our society and our individual rights. Without laws, there would be chaos and anarchy. The law provides a framework for us to live our lives in a safe and orderly manner.<br /><br />In addition, the law is a way of ensuring that everyone is treated fairly and equally. The law sets out clear rules and guidelines that everyone must follow. This helps to prevent discrimination and unfair treatment.<br /><br />Finally, obeying the law is a way of showing respect for the government and the legal system. By following the law, we are indicating that we support and believe in the system.	HMH[3]
qahckn	Can you be arrested by the military? Would they typically count as law enforcement? 	You can be arrested by the military police, if you are in the military.  But the military is not civilian law enforcement.  The national guard is sometimes called in for civilian issues, and in that capacity they can detain you, but I believe it's up to local law enforcement to officially arrest you.  I could be wrong on that.	Yes, you can be arrested by the military. They typically count as law enforcement.	HMH[3]
osj12v	How is it that lawsuits which were so obviously filed out of spite, anger, or by people clearly in the wrong, aren’t throw out immediately by the judge? Hypothetical example: Burglar sues home owner for $500K for injuries sustained while breaking into home.  In recent years, more and more professionals are afraid to do the right thing because “we might get sued” even if they did nothing wrong. Why are people allowed to weaponize the courts like this?	I see now that my actions were misguided lol😬	Not done with law school yet but I might be able to lend a little insight: what you’re talking about is usually called a “frivolous” claim. Typically the other sides’ lawyer would just file a motion to dismiss which, if the complaint was deemed frivolous, would be granted. Usually when you hear these scary stories about “innocent guy loses 500k case to his burglar” there’s a lot more to the story than what you’re being told. The McDonalds coffee suit is a perfect example because it wasn’t ridiculous at all but gets portrayed that way (wonder who’s behind that?), the coffee was heated to a degree that would never be safe to serve to a customer and resulted in very serious burns yet it often gets twisted as “look how ridiculous people are, they’ll sue even over coffee that’s a little too warm”.

onya0k	What's the difference between "Appeal to Authority" fallacy and "citing an authority" Whats the difference	&#x200B;<br />"I believe that the earth is round because I asked an Astrophysicist and they told me it was true."<br />This is 'citing an authority'.  You are citing information from a person who is an authority on the subject of the question.<br />&#x200B;<br />"I believe that the earth is flat because my elected Senator told me so."<br />This is an 'appeal to authority' fallacy.  You are citing information from a person who is in an authoritative position, but who may not necessarily have knowledge of the subject of the question.<br />&#x200B;<br />\*Apologies for the potentially political nature of the example question, I couldn't think of a better one.	We use different standards of proof when arguing. Sometimes, like in a mathematical proof, we want something that absolutely is correct if our premises are correct. <br />Since we can never say "This Authority is absolutely correct about all their assertions", then trying to claim such is a logical fallacy. <br />However, on a more practical heuristic level where absolute certainty isn't the goal but a reasonable guess at what's probably right is, then citing an authority is a reasonable guideline if you think the methods for declaring someone an authority were justified. For instance, if a great majority of the doctors in your country are well-trained, and they think epidemiologists are the best at knowing how to handle disease outbreaks, and they think that, say, Anthony Fauci is the best viral epidemiologist out there, then it might be reasonable to accept his advice on the subject as persuasive.

onmxs6	How does adverse possession work? (squatters rights)<br /> How can people just "squat" long enough that they are allowed to be there? If I stopped paying rent, I can't just stay and live there forever for free? So what am I not understanding about adverse possession? Hypothetically, if I trekked onto someone's private acreage and was able to go undetected for a set amount of time, that land could just become mine after long enough? Doesn't make sense!	Sovereign citizens and Moorish Americans would like you to believe that you can claim property by just squatting for a few years, but 99% of the time that is not the case, and you'll end up in jail. And if you forged a lease agreement, like so many do, you'll be going to federal prison. *That's the bad one where dropping the soap is a thing.*	Adverse possession is a legal doctrine that allows a person to gain ownership of a piece of property through continuous, exclusive, and uninterrupted use. In order to successfully claim adverse possession, the squatting individual must meet certain requirements set forth by state law, which vary from state to state. Generally speaking, the squatter must have been using the property for a certain period of time (usually 5-20 years), in a way that is open and notorious (meaning that the owner is aware of the squatter's use of the property), and with the intent to possess the property (meaning that the squatter must have the intention of using the property as their own). If these requirements are met, the squatter may be able to gain legal ownership of the property.<br /><br />There are a few exceptions to the rule of adverse possession. For example, if the property is owned by the government or if the squatter is a tenant of the property owner, the squatter will not be able to claim adverse possession. Additionally, some states have laws that specifically prohibit adverse possession (meaning that even if the requirements are met, the squatter will not be able to gain ownership of the property).<br /><br />So, in answer to your question, yes, it is possible for a squatter to gain legal ownership of a piece of property through adverse possession. However, there are a number of requirements that must be met in order for this to happen.	HMH[6]
pd457b	When and for what reason did the US get rid of "Dead or Alive" for bounties? I was playing RDR2 and just got curious.	I think the intent was less “Go shoot this guy lol” and more just meaning that you’ll still get the reward if you kill in self defense. For instance Jesse James was wanted “Dead or Alive,” but when Robert Ford just shot him in the back he was convicted of murder.  <br />Bounty hunters still exist, and they can kill in self defense (as can anybody else), so they never really went away even if that specific wording did.	Most were ended in the 1950's although the US did put a  "Dead or Alive" bounty on Osama Bin Laden. So they do exist in certain situations.	HHH[4][1]
pf3zj6	Why do people on death row stay there for months or even years before being executed? 	basically because of so called liberals. recently the prolific serial killer Rodney Alcala(creepiest person ever) died on death row in California at age 77. im sure he was warm and safe when he died.	Because the idea of the death penalty comes with an assumption that, since it is the ultimate punishment, it can never be allowed to happen to an innocent person. During the inmate's stay an extensive and expensive investigation is performed to ensure in absolute certainty there is no shade of doubt that this person actually did what they're being executed for.<br />If you want to see what happens when this process is NOT implemented, look into the case of John Christie and Timothy Evans.<br />In Great Britain, in January 1950, Timothy Evans turned himself in to the police, claiming he had accidentally caused the death of his wife by giving her medicine that was supposed to cause a miscarriage - Evans' wife got pregnant again soon after the birth of their daughter and the two could not afford the second child and abortion was illegal at the time. Evans claimed to have initially panicked, hid the body in a nearby sewer, gave his daughter to relatives, and tried to flee the country, but then, overcame with guilt, has turned himself in.<br />Police arrived in the sewer where Evans claimed to have hidden the body and not only didn't find any but realized a single man could not open the hatch to get down, as it took two officers to lift. Pressed Evans admitted to omitting the truth - he wasn't the one who gave his wife the medicine, it was his downstairs neighbour, John Christie. Christia informed Evans of the tragedy and convinced him it would be better if he disappeared for some time so no one connects him to his wife's death. Christie said he will hid the body in the sewers and make his relatives take care of Evans' daughter. Evans was covering him out of gratitude, understanding his wife's death was an accident.<br />Christie denied everything and suggested Evans may have hidden the body in the small garden adjacent to their apartment complex - he has found a part of it where it seems someone uprooted the earth. Quickly digging the cops found bodies of Evans' wife and daughter, both strangled.<br />Pressed again Evans signed a testimony admitting to having murdered his wife and child but later claimed he was forced to do it under threats of violence. In the court, he tried to accuse Christie but as someone who already has changed his testimony multiple times and had a shady past, his word could not stand to the word of respected former police officer Christie was. Evans was found guilty and executed in March of 1950.<br />In 1953 Christie moved out of his apartment. The new tenant immediately began renovating the place. And behind wallpaper in the kitchen found the bodies of three women. After informing the police someone looked into Evans' case and realized they never searched the whole garden, despite reports of dogs finding human bones in it. They never bothered to ask how Evans accessed a garden only Christie had the key to. They never looked into reports of Christie's violent behavior, including an assault on a woman. Digging through the garden revealed more bodies, from before and after Evans' case. Christie was apprehended and among his possessions was a newspaper clip of Evans being found guilty, as if it was something he was proud of.<br />John Christie was put on trial and found guilty of the murder of at least 8 women but the story doesn't end there. His sentencing made people question whenever Evans was not innocent and just framed by Christie. At the time government of Britain was very supportive of the death penalty and argued there is no way such a sentence would be accidentally performed on an innocent person. To avoid losing face the government called not one but two committees that both tried to claim they believe Evans was indeed guilty. Of course, it was a lie as no one would believe two people were living next to each other, killing the same type of victims at the same time and hiding them in the same spot and somehow did not notice each other. Meaning that defending the death penalty caused the spread of corruption among government officials of all levels. the case made a mockery of justice and is seen as one of the reasons why Great Britain abolished the death penalty.
