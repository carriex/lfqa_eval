pem5p5	how spiders produce webs<br />What are webs made out of and what do spiders convert in their bodies to produce the web substance? It seems like they produce so much web for the size of their bodies.	Webs are made out of a protein called silk. Spiders convert the protein into a liquid form in their bodies and then secrete it through their spinnerets. The liquid silk hardens when it comes into contact with the air, forming the web.<br /><br />Spiders can produce a lot of silk because they have a high concentration of the protein in their bodies. They also have special organs called spinnerets that are specifically designed for secreting the silk.	They have organs called spinnerets on their underside or rear. Each species of spider has a varying number of them, but usually they're in a cluster. On the end of each spinneret is a little nozzle-like spigot out of which a single silk thread comes (the silk is liquid when it's inside).<br />There are seven different kinds of silk gland which produce a slightly different kind of silk. No known species of spider has all of them.<br />The silk is pulled out of the spinneret by either gravity or one of their hind legs, and they then arrange it in a pattern of activity that differs greatly by species.

rob2j6	why we can't taste things when we have a stuffy nose, even though our taste buds still work?<br />	When we have a stuffy nose, the air flow to our olfactory bulb is blocked. This is the part of the brain responsible for our sense of smell. Without the olfactory bulb, we are unable to smell the molecules that we need to taste food.	You can only taste, with your tongue, a very small number of flavours.  Like half a dozen.<br />What you think of as taste is actually almost entirely smell.  We can detect millions of different smells.  When you have a stuffed nose you can't smell properly and so food "tastes" bland.	HMM[6]
oy2hz4	Does your body absorb all blood clots? How does it do it? Does location affect it?<br />	Kind of. Your blood will dissolve clots over time. I've got a clotting disorder and need to take thinners to make that happen faster, but for most they break down clots naturally settlement on how much blood flow there is to an area and if there's any muscle action to help break them up. They can be dangerous though when breaking up as the can travel to your heart, lungs or brain and cause death by blocking blood flow.	No, your body does not absorb all blood clots. Clots are usually broken down by the body's natural clotting mechanism, but some clots may persist and cause problems. Location can affect how quickly a clot is broken down. For example, clots in the veins are usually broken down more slowly than clots in the arteries.	HMH[5]
ql37ad	why do we as humans have the urge to pick scabs so much?<br />	As the skin regrows and starts filling out, the scab that formed does not grow with it, therefore causing irritation and pulling sensation that can only be gotten rid of by removing the scab so skin can fill out normally without the restraints of a scab. Vanity is also a large driver in wanting or needing to remove a scab. The above mentioned is really quite normal. <br />Skin picking really only becomes a problem when it causes significant disruptions in one's every day life.<br /> Dermatillomania is a form of obsessive compulsion disorder where a person will feel the compulsion to pick at their skin. <br />Body dysmorphic disorder can also cause a person to feel the compulsion to pick at their skin. <br />With both dermatillomania and body dysmorphic disorder a person's life is often disrupted by a large scale due to these compulsions.	I got news for ya. It isn't limited to humans. Hence, why we give our pets the "cone of shame". They fuck with their wounds too!	HHH[51][17]
oslh5t	why do we have goosebumps ? i know it's because of cold/fear, but why does our body do that ?<br />	I think it’s one of those ancestral features we still have to these days. Think of those mammals who use fur to get bigger in order to scary predators or fluffier to get warmer in cold weather. That’s goosebumps basically!	It's a reaction that puffs up our body hair to trap more air to keep us warm or make us look bigger. Humans lost our fur, but not the reaction. Hope this helps	HHh[5][10]
ro9zsh	What is happening when you get migraines that cause you to lose part of your vision for a short time?<br />	When you get migraines that cause you to lose part of your vision for a short time, you are experiencing a migraine with aura. Auras are visual disturbances that can occur before or during a migraine. They typically last for less than an hour and can include seeing flashes of light, zig-zag lines, or blind spots. Some people also experience other aura symptoms, such as changes in smell, taste, or touch.	My wife gets these.<br />An ocular migraine is a condition where the blood vessels in the optic nerve at the back of your eye tighten and swell, resulting in various visual distortions. While classic migraines  usually result in intense headaches, sensitivity to light and loud sounds, or nausea, ocular migraines are not necessarily painful.	HMM[96]
qjiqfr	Why do older black tattoos look blue?<br />Why do black tattoos look navy blue after a few years?<br />I’ve got a few that are looking a lot more blue than black now they’re a few years old. I know age and being in the sun a lot changes tattoos colour but I’ve always been super careful with tattoo specific sun screen when I’m outside. <br />I understand tattoos can “spread” over time but my other coloured tattoos still are the original colour, whereas the black mostly looks dark blue now.<br />Why is it that black “fades” so fast?	If I recall it's because they used "India Ink" for most tattoos, I'm not very familiar with it but if you search online I'm sure you can find a more detailed explanation.<br />Edit: Quote from an article I found after searching google for 10 seconds: some Indian inks have been known to turn a grey, blue or green color while fading too making your tattoo look even worse."	There are a few reasons why older black tattoos may look blue. First, as tattoos age, the ink can spread and become thinner, making the colors appear less saturated. Second, exposure to sunlight can cause tattoo ink to fade, and black ink is particularly susceptible to this. Finally, some inks contain pigments that are not very stable and can break down over time, resulting in a change in color.	HMH[7]
of1qmt	If under anesthesia do you get your sleep needed for the day?<br />	No. The unconsciousness induced by both IV anesthetics and inhaled anesthetics is very different from restorative sleep. In fact, patients in ICUs who are sedated for long periods of time with some of the same medications they use in anesthesia get delirium from both a lack of sleep and a lack of proper awake time. <br />This is also true for prescription benzodiazepines like Ativan (lorazepam) and Xanax (alprazolam) which are often prescribed for insomnia but do not produce true sleep. <br />There is an IV sedative called Dexmedetomodine (precedex) that produces an unconsciousness more similar to sleep and has been shown to reduce the risk of ICU delirium vs more common medications like propofol. It is also used as an adjunct in anesthetic practice. But it is not nearly as prominent as propofol or inhaled anesthetics for a few reasons. First, it takes longer to work so after a dose you have to wait 15-30min for it to take effect (propofol is within a minute or so) and it lasts longer once it is stopped. Additionally, up until recently it was on patent and quite expensive. The patent recently expired and it is seeing increased use but I doubt it will ever become as popular as propofol.  <br />EDIT: Precedex also isn't a full anesthetic in standard practice so for surgery under general anesthesia it still needs to be used with another medicine like propofol or anesthesia gas.  Thanks u/bluejay54 for the reminder.  <br />True ELI5: Sleep = charging your phone on airplane mode. Anesthesia = turning your phone off but not charging it. credit to u/greatpiginthesty<br />I am an ICU RN and am starting anesthesia training soon.	There is no clear consensus on whether or not people under anesthesia get the sleep they need for the day. Some studies suggest that people under anesthesia do get some sleep, but it is not clear how deep or restful this sleep is. Other studies suggest that people under anesthesia do not get any meaningful sleep at all. Therefore, it is difficult to say definitively whether or not people under anesthesia get the sleep they need for the day.	HMH[928]
p8upbj	Why dental tartar is so hard and bounds to teeth like glue? It's like a secondary tooth made of bacterias.<br />	I brush twice a day, waterpik nightly and visit dentist every 6 months. I still get tartar build up. Now here is my question, I have receding gums (already has surgery to help mitigate), why can tartar stick to teeth but they can't come up with something to coat my teeth below the gumline to protect them. <br />Dentistry is amazing in what they can do but this seems like a fairly simple thing to fix seeing that they can whiten, lighten, root canal, and laminate my pearly whites.	Dental tartar is hard because it is made up of minerals that have been deposited on the teeth. These minerals are mostly calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate, which are very hard. The bacteria in dental tartar also contribute to its hardness, as they produce a sticky substance that binds the tartar to the teeth.	HMH[6]
ocxgex	How are sperms made in the body?<br />More specifically, how does a Sperm become X or Y sperm.	Not going too much into the scientificy details, mainly because I don't remember them from high school  2 decades ago, but basically the cell division that occurs to form the reproductive cells (sperm/eggs) in humans is not the same as the cell division for none reproductive cells. <br />When the "normal" cells split, they create complete copies of each chromosome pair (your DNA is made of pairs of each chromosome. One comes from the father, one from the mother), so the child cells end up with a complete set of DNA. <br />Reproductive cells split the chromosome pairs. The child cells only receive one chromosome from each pair. In the case of the sex chromosome pair, a male has an XY pair and a female has an XX pair. So when a male creates reproductive cells (sperm), one sperm will receive the X chromosome and the other will have the Y chromosome.	When most cells divide, they copy themselves once then split once, so both copied cells have X *and* Y. Sperm basically come from 1 copy but 2 splits, so you get one X sperm and one Y sperm from the second split.	HHH[4][0]
okh5it	Why do people tell a dying person to stay awake, or to stay with them?<br />I see this in a lot of films and series; a person has a shotwound or some other fatal injury and the one helping them tells him/her to "stay with them" or to "don't fall asleep." Why do they say that? Is it just something that happens in movies? Or does it have a serious reason?<br />I asked my brother this question and he said that they say that to prevent people going into shock, but he answered quite unsure. And if this is the answer, why would we prevent people from going into shock. Your body goes into shock to stay alive longer, so wouldn't it be a good thing? <br />I couldn't find anything on google, but maybe that's just because I'm bad at finding things on google. Also, english isn't my first language, so excuse me if there are any spelling or grammar errors.	You're referring to somone who is dying from a grievous injury or overdose, and not of natural causes. <br />When alert the pituitary gland in the brain produces ACTH, vassopressin and cortisol, especially when one knows one is in danger. ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce adrenaline,  and norepinephrine.<br />Epinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, and cortisol all act to contract blood vessels and raise blood pressure.  The first two raise heart rate and increse breathing rate. Cortisol releases glucose from the liver. <br />This can all reduce blood loss from an injury. It can also prevent *shock* which is a catastrophic drop in blood pressure that can be difficult to reverse once it sets in. Untreated shock typically results in loss of oxygen to the brain resulting in brain injury and rapid death.<br />In the case of a drug overdose or alcohol poisoning this is important as it keeps the victim breathing.	It’s for dramatic effect. <br />If you were fatally wounded to the point of losing enough blood that you could go into shock and lose consciousness, you’re beyond the point of your nervous system being able to keep your blood pressure high enough to power your brain.

q85ty8	Why do so many youth get their tonsils removed?<br />	For quite some time it was believed that they were useless leftovers from the past that we don’t need anymore, vestigial organ. If they got infected it was just easier to remove them and not deal with repeat infections. Now we know that they are not a vestigial organ and are not useless. Since we know this now they try to leave them in and just deal with infections, however sometimes they do still need to come out for reasons. It won’t majorly affect your life not having them, as millions of people have survived without them just fine. But they do have a use in our bodies and if they can be left in they should be.	Worth noting that it varies wildly according to where you are. The extremes are from 1.9/100,000 to 11.8/100,000 <br />It was very common when I was a kid in the 60s - more than a few sore throats in a year and they wanted to take them out. My parents resisted - and eventually it settled down anyway.	HHH[9][3]
of4sri	Why is it so important for humans to have a balanced nutrition but not for animals?<br />Most animals have a fairly simple diet, carnivores eat only meat their whole life, cows eat exclusively grass etc. So why are human bodies so picky and need a balance of protein, fat, carbs etc from different sources to perform well?	Your question includes a few common misconceptions, one that's been addressed already.<br />Humans need a balanced diet, but that doesn't necessarily imply a vast array of food types. That simply means the nutritional value of our food has to cover our needs. <br />It doesn't have to be varied. You can very well thrive by eating the same handful of things every day.	The human body is much more complex than the bodies of most animals. Humans need a balance of nutrients in order to function properly. Protein, fat, and carbohydrates are all essential nutrients that the body needs in order to function.<br /><br />Animals generally have a simpler diet than humans. For example, carnivores only eat meat, while cows only eat grass. However, the human body is much more complex and needs a variety of different nutrients to function properly. A balanced diet is essential for humans in order to maintain good health.	HMH[910]
pthext	why can some animals go for months without eating but humans need to eat within a couple of days?<br />	We can. [A man who weighed 456 lbs. was able to go 382 days with no food at all](https://www.sciencealert.com/the-true-story-of-a-man-who-survived-without-any-food-for-382-days). Just like a hibernating bear, we can live an extended amount of time just on fat stores alone.	Humans don't need to eat within a couple of days--even without vitamin supplements you can survive a good couple of months without food. They won't be \*pleasant\* months by any means, but you'll survive. Water, on the other hand, is critical. Three days without that and you're almost certainly pushing up daisies.	HHH[5][1]
pd9qbh	Why do people go bald on the top of their head and still have some on the sides and not vice-versa?<br />	There are a few reasons why people go bald on the top of their head and still have some hair on the sides. One reason is that the hair follicles on the top of the head are more sensitive to a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is a byproduct of testosterone and is found in both men and women. When DHT levels are high, it can cause the hair follicles on the top of the head to miniaturize, which leads to hair loss. Another reason is that the hair on the sides and back of the head is not as exposed to the sun and other environmental factors, which can damage the hair and lead to hair loss.	Seems unsettled but here’s a theory:<br />“The most recent hypothesis suggests that the hair loss process begins during puberty, when growth of the skull and the muscles in the forehead and neck increases the tension in a tight band of tissue stretching over the top of the head. The more DHT (a type of testosterone) there is, the more these muscles contract, which causes inflammation and brings in more DHT. Over time, the DHT thickens the band of tissue, restricting the supply of blood and nutrients to the hair follicles above it. The follicles on top of the head get smaller and eventually disappear, while those on the sides of the head remain largely unaffected.”<br />Source<br />https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/why-do-men-go-bald-from-the-top-of-their-heads/	HMM[900]
pr8mn3	Why does darkness in a dark room feel different than the darkness when you close your eyes?<br />	Your eyelids are not very good at blocking light. Their main job is to protect and moisturise the eyes, not prevent you seeing things, that's just a useful bonus. After all, we evolved in a world where there was very little artificial light. At night, it would be pitch black - there'd be no extra light for your eyes to block as you're trying to sleep anyway. If you pay attention next time you close your eyes in a bright environment, you'll notice that what you're seeing isn't black, it's a red glow. This is the light passing through your blood-filled eyelid skin.	In my experience, this comes from the fact that in one situation you do not control the darkness while the other is you in control of your shutters.<br />Maybe someone else can dive further into this.

olzm6d	How are deep sea animals not more resilient at the surface?<br />This might sound like a dumb question but I promise I'm serious. I was watching a video on the depth of the ocean and it got me curious how deep sea creatures don't immediately squash under all that pressure. I did some reading on it and from what I saw, fish/squid/etc lack swim bladders and as a result lack anything left in their bodies to be compressed. Yet I'm still a bit confused on how these animals even open their mouths under all that weight.. how they have an open stomach. Wouldn't that be flattened as well? The only thing I could think of is that the pressure inside their bodies maybe equalize the pressure on the outside.<br />Which brings me the to the last part of the question. As a part of that video, I saw that a leatherback sea turtle has a maximum diving depth of 1,280 meters. Yet just before that it mentioned that the pressure that far down is roughly equivalent to a polar bear standing on a postage stamp. I can kind of overlook how fish do it, but I can't really imagine a polar bear standing on a sea turtle's face and it be just fine. I can't even imagine me being able to punch a sea turtle in the face and it being fine. Yet apparently it's somehow invincible.	Fill a baloon with water. Immerse it in water. What do you think the water is going to do with it?<br />Of course it's squishy, especially outside water, but it's not like water can somehow compress other water which is what's mostly inside most creatures.	There are a few reasons why deep sea animals are not more resilient at the surface. One reason is that they lack swim bladders, which helps them to float. Without this, they would sink to the bottom of the ocean and be crushed by the pressure. Another reason is that they have a higher density than surface animals, which makes it harder for them to float. Finally, deep sea animals have adapted to the high pressure and cold temperatures of the deep ocean, and would not be able to survive in the warmer, shallower waters of the surface.	HMH[9]
rb8nfj	Why aren't identical twins half the size of single humans?<br />If identical twins are created when a single fertilized egg splits on half during development, why do those two halves form into normal humans? Wouldn't they only have half of the normal mass/size of a single-child pregnancy? I mean, if a fertilized egg splits and the two fragments can form into two normal sized humans, wouldn't that mean if the egg never split, the single human would have the mass/size of the two twins combined? Does the cell somehow know that it split, and somehow it then knows that despite losing half of what it already had as a single egg, it needs to develop as if it never had the material from the portion that split off? Sorry if this sounds like rambling, but I can't find any information on this topic online.	The egg does not contain all the material of the final human being. Eggs are large by cell standards - they're about the size of the period at the end of this sentence if you're using a typical monitor - but they're much smaller than a fetus or newborn child.<br />And in fact, the fertilized egg *doesn't* typically split in half with identical twins. Instead, identical twins diverge a little later in development (a few days in) during the split between the cells that form the placenta and the cells that form what will eventually be the final human. A single layer of cells (called the *trophoblast*) forms the placenta, and inside that is a blob of cells (the "inner cell mass") that forms the embryo. In identical twins, *two* inner cell masses form instead of one. But at this point the placenta attaches to and begins receiving nutrients from the uterine wall.<br />So while the two embyros begin slightly smaller than they otherwise would, they have access to outside nutrients very early in development, and it's those outside nutrients that enable actual growth in size.	> Does the cell somehow know that it split, and somehow it then knows that despite losing half of what it already had as a single egg, it needs to develop as if it never had the material from the portion that split off? <br />Essentially, yes.  Identical twinning is a genetically transmitted characteristic, so the initial cell would "know" that it was going to twin, and would have to go through one extra division.	HHH[5][0]
rf93z3	Why isn't there a single pill that contains all the necessary vitamins, minerals and other nutritions one needs?<br />	What would happen to the gut microbiome?	Because you are expected to eat some of your necessary vitamins throughout the day in your food. Vitamin pills are supplements to cover the parts that are not in everyday foods	HHh[3][1]
ro8iah	Why do bugs love the underside of rocks or fallen logs anyway?<br />is it the humidity? the darkness? also why?	It's to hide from predators, birds and rodents especially. Birds and rodents will eat the hell out of small insects so they hide to prevent this from happening, so they can continue to reproduce and keep from going extinct. Also there's a lot of moisture there too so thats a big plus	Humidity can play an important part, especially in warmer environments where exposed water evaporates fast enough to be dangerous for unprotected worms. Another one is that rocks provide protection from birds.	HHh[4][1]
