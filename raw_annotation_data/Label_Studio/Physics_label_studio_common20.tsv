piabj1	Since force is related to a change in momentum and not necessarily just to a change in velocity, what would be an example where only the mass of a body changes but not its velocity when subjected to a force? 	Momentum is something that exists in mass. If you apply a force, it inherently *must* change an object's velocity (however slightly) and does not change its mass.<newline>To increase the momentum of an object, you must decrease the momentum of another object, as momentum is a conserved quantity. Note that momentum is a vector, and so a "decrease" could just as well mean an increase in the opposite direction. The force 'moves' momentum between the two objects.<newline>The force could, instead, move mass between the two objects, but the scenario is a bit odd, since the new mass isn't necessarily the same object but simply travels alongside the object.<newline>For example, imagine a very fast aircraft flying over enemy territory. So fast that it keeps pace with bullets. The enemy fires upon the aircraft, but the bullets can only match speeds with it and will not damage it. The bullets are now traveling with the aircraft, and with some mid-flight gluing they could become a part of it. In this case, the force of firing the bullet is pumping mass to the object without changing its velocity.	My first thought was particle accelerators where the particles are close to the universal speed limit and will therefore not go any faster no matter how much acceleration you give them but will instead increase in mass. However /u/LordSpazpatty is completely right with the hovering rocket example as well as the mass is reduced due to fuel being burned by the engines requiring less force to keep the same acceleration.

otkdy0	how can humans survive in the channel tunnel without a pressure suit? But no at that depth in sea? Is this down to the difference in density between air and water or is the air in the channel tunnel pressurised?	The tunnel is only full of air, so going that deep isn't as big of a deal. Water weighs A LOT more, so at that depth there is more weight crushing you.	Did a ctrl+f for pressure on the wikipedia page and found:<newline>> The ventilation system maintains the air pressure in the service tunnel higher than in the rail tunnels, so that in the event of a fire, smoke does not enter the service tunnel from the rail tunnels.<newline>So, yes there is a ventilation system that maintains the air pressure.<newline>> Trains travelling at high speed create piston effect pressure changes that can affect passenger comfort, ventilation systems, tunnel doors, fans and the structure of the trains, and which drag on the trains.[199] Piston relief ducts of 2-metre (7 ft) diameter were chosen to solve the problem, with 4 ducts per kilometre to give close to optimum results.<newline>I found this pretty interesting. They had to install vents because the trains running into the air was causing pressure problems.	HHH[7][1]
q4mq35	Where do magnets get their energy to repel other magnets from? Does it last forever? 	Magnetism is like gravity. Lift a ball off the ground, and you're putting in energy. Push two magnets together, and you're putting in energy. Let go, and the energy is released.<newline>Magnetism doesn't last forever, either. It's a result of the poles being aligned. Heat will shake them out of alignment.	A more poetic non-answer is: When I sing, where does the melody come from?	HHH[7][-11]
oca3gx	If opposite poles attract, why does the North side of a compass point north instead of south? 	The reason that the north side of a compass points north instead of south is because opposite poles attract each other. The north pole of the compass is attracted to the south pole of the earth, and vice versa. This interaction between the poles is what causes the compass needle to point in a particular direction.	The opposite electrical charges attract. There's nothing that actually matters about how we label them as North and South. For a compass, we've made it so the side that points to the magnetic north pole is labeled as North.	HMM[2]
p5p19j	If light has no mass, why does it bend in the presence of gravity? 	Light doesn‚Äôt have mass in the conventional sense. Einstein theorized, essentially, that there can be no energy without mass. If E= 0, and c^2 is a constant, then m= 0. If m=0, then there is no energy. Light IS energy.<newline>So! Light ACTS like it has mass while in motion, and has no mass when at a halt. The answer you‚Äôre looking for is: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è	Light travels in space. Gravity warps space, while light just keeps following wherever it goes. Although gravity doesn't affect photons, it does affect the surface upon which they move.	HHH[17][1]
pkoeyj	How the bodies/remains from 9/11 couldn't be found/are "just gone" from a building collapse? 	The most optimal range of a crematorium oven is 1400-1800 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures at ground zero were as high as 1377. So, while not optimal, it can still turn a body into dust over weeks (the fires burned for 100 days).	There are a number of potential explanations for why the bodies/remains from 9/11 couldn't be found/are "just gone" from a building collapse. One possibility is that the bodies were completely incinerated in the intense heat of the collapse. Another possibility is that the bodies were pulverized by the force of the collapse. Finally, it is also possible that the bodies were buried beneath the rubble and simply couldn't be recovered.	HMH[87]
otsryu	how does a speaker vibrate at multiple frequencies simultaneously to deliver sounds to our ears? I'll try and explain what I mean.. say a song is playing - how do the vocals, drums, guitars etc which all have different frequencies (aka a plate is moving back &amp; forth at a rate to deliver these sound waves) play at the same time? Surely the plate can't vibrate to deliver two or more frequencies at once?	This has been asked many times and the answer is they don‚Äôt. If you listen to the song being played live on purely acoustic instruments even though they are being played separately and emitting their own frequencies, what you hear (and by extension, what a microphone captures) at any given time is just ONE frequency that‚Äôs the ‚Äúsum‚Äù of all the others combined. A speaker is just a reverse microphone.	Imagine an ocean with a consistent wave. It flows up and down, with equal distance between the two waves at any time.<newline>Now imagine I push a larger, shorter wave into this ocean. The two waves will collide, resulting in some new wave pattern. This new wave pattern is a combination of those two waves.<newline>Speakers work similarly. If I combine two soundwaves, I get a new combination wave that sounds different.	HHh[8][1]
rejr3t	what theories are out there about what came before the Big Bang? 	The current model for what happened before the big bang is known as cosmic inflation.<newline>The basic idea is that the Big Bang on its own explains many of the observations made my scientists regarding the structure of the universe. However, what is interesting is that there are several observations that the Big Bang *cannot* explain, such as:<newline>\- why was the universe "born" perfectly flat?<newline>\- why is the universe the same temperature (up to over 99% accuracy) in all directions when there hasn't been enough time for the temperature of the universe to "even out" all the way?<newline>\- why aren't there various high-energy relics (like magnetic monopoles - a magnet that's only North or South, but *not both*) when the Standard Model (the current frame work of the smallest particles in physics) predicted that such relics should exist as a result of the insanely high energy of the Big Bang?<newline>\- why did the universe begin with such low entropy (which is a measure of "disorder" in a system)? Especially considering the fact that entropy always increases in closed systems?<newline>After the Big Bang model became accepted in the first half of the 1900's, scientists have struggled to answer these questions above according to the framework of the Big Bang.<newline>However, in the '70s and '80s a scientist named Alan Guth came up with a model explains everything the Big Bang did, *and* also explains the unsolved observations not accounted by the Big Bang. This model is known as cosmic inflation, and put simply it is the idea that the energy in the first moments of universe wasn't in particles or radiation, but in the fabric of space itself. So what happened *before* the Big Bang is that the fabric of space itself began to exponentially inflate to an unimaginable degree, and we call the "Big Bang" is actually the end of this inflationary period.<newline>So then that begs the question: what happened before the inflationary period? Sadly, no one knows. It is possible that some kind of singularity existed before inflation. It is also possible that inflation never stopped, which would imply the existence of a multiverse. Or it could be that inflations happen cyclically, which implies an eternal universe.<newline>What's really interesting here is that the scientists who figured out and basically proved that inflation came first did this forty years ago. So anyone who still tries to argue that the Big Bang was the first event in the universe is at least forty years outdated.	Tesla said there is a primordial soup and we are being churned in it - that would be the big bang, the start of the churn, so the soup would be there but motionless, or the possibility of all motion, however you want to look at it.

qqrg9l	Why can‚Äôt we dispose of nuclear waste by shooting it into deep space? 	The main reason why we can't dispose of nuclear waste by shooting it into deep space is because it would be incredibly expensive to do so. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the waste would not eventually come back to Earth, potentially causing harm to our planet and its inhabitants.	Cost. Currently to get mass into low earth orbit it costs many thousands of dollars per kg. We don't want to fill low earth orbit with waste so really we need it on at least an earth escape trajectory, and ideally a sun escape. This ramps up the cost even more. Storing nuclear waste is a hassle, but it isn't as expensive or dangerous as launching it into space.	HMM[7]
ow9jbd	How is energy conserved when two forces counteract? If there are 2 forces on the same object, that counteract, the object doesn't move.<br />But there was energy released to create these forces. If these forces don't cause anything to move, doesn't it mean that that energy was destroyed?	Applying perfectly opposite forces in a perfectly static and rigid world - doesn't actually expend any energy. The act of applying a force doesn't expend energy - its the act of applying a force over a distance which does.<newline>In the real world, since everything is elastic, the thing you are compressing/stretching with your forces, plus the structure that the forces are reacting against will act like stiff springs - and this is where the energy gets stored.<newline>For example press your hands together in front of your chest. As you press:<newline>* Some energy gets stored into the squishing of your palms<newline>* Some energy gets stored in the compression of the bones in your forearms<newline>* Some energy gets stored in the tension of your upper arms and the bones across your shoulders<newline>The chances are some energy will be lost to heat, since flesh is unlikely to be a particularly efficient elastic. <newline>Since you don't apply the force over much distance, very little energy is stored. If you put a spring between your hands, now you apply the force over more distance and more energy is stored (which is apparent when you let the spring go!)	Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one type to another. In this case, the energy was converted from potential energy to kinetic energy and then back to potential energy. The object didn't move, so the kinetic energy was quickly converted back to potential energy.	HMH[9]
qn082t	how does a nuclear reactor and nuclear energy work? How does a nuclear reactor and nuclear energy work?	A nuclear reactor uses radioactive materials as their fuel source. A chain reaction is started where neutrons slam into the other atoms which in turn also shoot off neutrons. But these neutrons are flying away at a high rate of speed, and they need to be slowed down a bit to make them more likely to hit another atom; this is where the moderator comes in. There are a few different things that can do this function, even just water.<newline>To control the reaction so they can make it happen more slowly over time instead of releasing all that insane energy at once, things such as control rods (which instead absorb neutrons instead of just slowing them down) are also put in the reactor.<newline>All this neutron whizzing about breaking other atoms like a cue ball on a pool table creates heat, crazy amounts of heat. This is captured via what is called the primary loop, which is water that is being circulated through the reactor both to help keep it cool and to collect that heat. This then goes to an exchanger where the primary water heats up secondary water (you don't want the primary water which is being exposed to neutron radiation to be outside the containment), and this secondary water gets turned into steam. This is what actually drives the steam turbines.<newline>Tldr: Nuclear reactions are atoms losing pieces that bump into other atoms and make them break up too, this makes shitloads of heat. The heat is collected and used for running a steam turbine.	A nuclear reactor is a device used to initiate and control a nuclear chain reaction. Nuclear reactors are used to generate electricity and to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. <newline><newline>Nuclear power plants use nuclear fission to generate electricity. In a typical nuclear power plant, uranium fuel is enriched to about 3-5% U-235 and then formed into pellets. These pellets are then placed in fuel rods, which are bundled together to form a fuel assembly. <newline><newline>The fuel assembly is placed in the reactor core, where the nuclear fission reaction takes place. The fission reaction releases heat, which is used to generate steam. The steam turns turbines, which generate electricity. <newline><newline>Nuclear reactors are closely regulated to ensure the safety of the public and the environment. Nuclear power plants must meet strict safety and security regulations.	HMH[4]
pgeptm	Why do heavy objects fall at the same speed as light ones? Shouldn't gravity make objects which mass is greater attract each other more and therefore touch each other more quickly? Or maybe the mass of the Earth is so big that the difference between two objects in perspective is negligible, especially on the very short distance between them and the soil? Not sure... could you explain?	They do attract each other more, heavy objects fall with a greater force than light objects they just fall at the same velocity. The impact of a heavy object when it hits the ground is far greater, but force = mass times acceleration so the greater mass is balanced out by the greater force.	Physics. Terminal velocity is a thing that matters a lot more than it seems. Also weight/mass while related, are two separate factors out of many factors that affect speed of falling objects. I‚Äôm definitely no physics person, but I believe that a heavier object needs more time to get to terminal velocity even though with enough time it will ultimately have a greater pull on it due to being heavier. A smaller object will reach terminal velocity more quickly, but it won‚Äôt go as fast. These two things exist on a parabola where there‚Äôs a lot of overlap because there‚Äôs often not a large enough free fall. Example of physics, an average sized human‚Äôs free fall terminal velocity is about 85-90mph, but a streamlined human can get to well over 100, and a human wearing specific clothing/attire can get even faster in a fall. That‚Äôs a variance of 60-70mph ultimately in an object that‚Äôs the same mass/size/relatively same shape just oriented differently or otherwise affecting drag.	HHH[2][0]
rnoy1b	what causes race cars to sometimes spin out when taking a turn? The only understanding I have is that applying too much throttle can be attributed to this, but how does increasing acceleration lead to a loss of control?	So many things, surface condition, oversteer, understeer, condition of the tyres, cornering speed - bear in mind race cars usually operating on the very edge of grip - with the downforce they provide, so any marginal thing will likely cause it to ‚Äúsnap‚Äù and spin	It depends on the type of car why they spun. Front wheel drive cars spin when you close the throttle mid turn. Rear wheel drive cars spin when you go too fast into it or accelerate too soon and all wheel drive cars do both but less often.	HHH[7][2]
pct80b	Why when holding a magnifying glass in a certain angle on a sunny day causes things like wood and cotton to burn? 	Sunlight carries with it energy. About a thousand watts per square meter on a good day. A 6-cm magnifying glass takes up about 0.28% of a square meter, so it will be collecting around 2.8 watts of power - that's about a fifth of a small candle. It is concentrated down to a very small area - smaller than a candle flame, and so as far as that small area is concerned, it may as well be held over a flame.	A magnifying glass works by gathering the light from a larger area and focussing it into a smaller area. When using a magnifying glass normally, you're taking the light bouncing off the thing you're looking at and focussing it into your eye-hole.<newline>If you bring a magnifying glass outside on a sunny day, [this happens](https://i.imgur.com/sJxraPg.png). All the sunlight (and heat energy) that hits the whole large surface of the magnifying glass gets focused and concentrated to be hitting a MUCH smaller point. So like, if you focus the power onto a spot 1/100th the size of the glass itself, that spot gets 100x more heat on it than just being in normal sunlight. Also notice you're not creating energy here. The hot spot gets a shadow around it. You're just moving and gathering most of the light that would have hit the circle and redistributing it into a much smaller spot and leaving a shadow around that spot.	HHH[4][1]
pngr94	why does water spill when first poured from full pitchers/carafes? I was pouring my coffee today, and when the carafe is full, the coffee has a tendency to spill or dribble down the outside of the carafe. This isn't an issue when the carafe is less full.	Roughly speaking, water doesn't like air, but does like glass (and some other things).<newline>So as you tip things the water clings to the glass so it touches as little air as possible and as much glass as possible.<newline>But once it gets flowing there is enough of a push to break that.	There are a few reasons why water spills when first poured from full pitchers or carafes. One reason is that when the pitcher or carafe is full, the weight of the water can cause the spout to open slightly, which allows water to drip or spill out. Another reason is that when the container is full, the water level is higher than the spout, so the water has to travel further to reach the spout, which can cause it to spill or dribble out. Finally, when the container is full, the water is also under more pressure, which can cause it to spill or dribble out if the spout is not opened wide enough.	HMH[9]
r0o0l5	if theres no gravity in space how do rockets steer/move? Wouldn't it be hard land perpendicular on the moon? 	They use thrusters, which are tiny "rocket engines" (sometimes they just puff gas under pressure) on the sides of the ship.  Gravity actually has little to do with it - it's the lack of air that makes aerodynamic surfaces like ailerons and rudders ineffective.	Rockets are able to steer and move in space because they rely on the force of their engines to propel them in the desired direction. Without gravity, there is nothing to pull them back down to the surface of a planet or moon, so they can continue moving in a straight line indefinitely. This can make landing on a planet or moon tricky, as it can be difficult to judge the correct angle and approach needed to land perpendicular on the surface.	HMH[3]
rk149p	If the JWST will observe photons of light coming from the creation of the universe, how are we already so far away from the place where it happened? 	This question is based on a common misconception. The Big Bang didn't happen in a specific location, it happened **everywhere**. The idea though is that all *locations* were much closer together in the early universe so all places had basically no distance from each other. As the universe expanded more distance rapidly came into existence; things weren't flying apart moving *through* space, the *space itself* was getting more distant from other locations.<newline>The universe even when very close and dense was still likely infinite in extent.	The JWST will observe photons of light coming from the creation of the universe, but we are already far away from the place where it happened. The universe is expanding, and the further away something is from us, the faster it is moving away from us. So, the photons that the JWST will observe are coming from a time when the universe was much smaller and denser than it is now.	HMH[6]
p271e8	Where is the universe expanding to? I know this has already been asked, but how /where is it expanding? If the end of the universe is the end of everything, then how is it getting bigger? What is the area outside of the universe that is being taken over as the universe expands?	There is no agreed-upon answer to this question since there is no agreed-upon model of the universe. Some scientists believe that the universe is infinite and so it is not expanding into anything, while others believe that it is expanding into a higher dimensional space. Some scientists also believe that the universe will eventually stop expanding and start contracting again. There is no definitive answer to this question since there is no definitive model of the universe.	Nothing.   <newline>Because if there was something, it would be part of the universe.   <newline>When they say the universe is expanding, they mean that everything is getting further apart from each other everywhere. Not that there's a not-universe the universe is displacing.	HMM[4]
rpp1h4	If atoms never touch each other then how does sound travel between them? There can‚Äôt be sounds in space because of the vacuum (no matter). How does sound travel between atoms if they never touch each other? Isn‚Äôt there nothing in between the atoms?	There are *forces* between atoms. However it‚Äôs extremely difficult to intuitively grasp or explain these forces because they don‚Äôt resemble anything else with which we are familiar. <newline>Here‚Äôs Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman explaining why you can‚Äôt really explain such forces to a five year old, or even to an intelligent adult who is not a physicist:<newline>https://youtu.be/MO0r930Sn_8	They do push against each other without touching. Like how the same poles of two magnets push against each other without touching. Does that help?	HHH[5][1]
q04psp	Why can‚Äôt we just build more nuclear power stations to reduce carbon emissions? 	There are several reasons why we can't just build more nuclear power stations to reduce carbon emissions. First, nuclear power is expensive to build and maintain. Second, nuclear power plants produce radioactive waste that is difficult to dispose of safely. Finally, nuclear power plants can be potential targets for terrorist attacks.	Easy enough to do.  Nuclear has an image problem, though.  People don't like them and don't want them around, so permitting is a nightmare.  California just shut down its last nuclear plant, in fact.	HMM[9]
