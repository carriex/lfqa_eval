    "question_text": "I remember learning about an ex prisoner who was brought to America to help train the soldiers. But the details escape me. Can anyone provide details to who he was?",
    "answer1": "Those clues are kind of vague, but one possible candidate *might* be Casimir Pulaski. He was an effective cavalry officer who was embroiled in the chaos of Poland in the later 18th c. and fought on a losing side, but while he was tried and condemned and his possessions confiscated, he'd fled to France  by then. So, \"ex prisoner\" is not *quite* correct. But he did indeed help train American cavalry- and irritated quite a few who served with him with his imperious manner. If you heard about him in the US, it might be because there are a lot of towns named after him, and he became quite a popular hero to later Polish-Americans.<br />Pienkos, A. (1976).

    "answer2": "The ex-prisoner mentioned is most likely Jean-Baptiste Charbonneau, also known as Pomp. He was the son of Sacagawea and Toussaint Charbonneau, and accompanied the Lewis and Clark expedition as a young child.<br />Jean-Baptiste was born in 1805 and captured by the Hidatsa tribe at a young age. He spent several years living with the Hidatsa before being traded to the Lewis and Clark expedition in exchange for horses. Lewis and Clark took him under their wing, and he spent the next several years traveling with them across the country.<br />In 1811, the expedition returned to St. Louis and Jean-Baptiste was placed in the care of William Clark. Clark helped to educate him and arranged for him to be trained as a blacksmith.<br />Jean-Baptiste spent the next few years working as a blacksmith in St. Louis. In 1823, he was hired by the US government to help train soldiers at Fort Atkinson in Wisconsin. He continued to work as a blacksmith and soldier until his death in 1866.",

However, I can't find any reliable sources on exactly how these firearms were protected. Some say they were blued, others that they just slapped on a load of radiator paint. Still others talk about anodising but that seems unlikely to me based on examples I've seen. I've also heard that they simply weren't protected at all, notably with the Sten gun.",
    "answer1": "As you likely have noticed, there are LOTS of ways to blue a firearm. What makes it confusing is that both browning and blueing are making an iron oxide layer, and a blued finish will, on exposure to the elements ( like, someone goes hunting) bit by bit revert to regular brown rust, so quite a lot of guns are now brown that were once blue ( there's a gunsmith invocation over blueing: \"from rust you came, to rust you shall return\"). <br />In the later 1800's it was discovered that a phosphate coating could be created that was more stable than blueing or browning. The patent history is a bit complex, but the process was made practical after 1900, and in 1918 the Parker Rust-Proof Company started up in Detroit. Because of them , the finish has since generally been called parkerizing, and it was adopted by Springfield Armory and contractors as the standard finish on US small arms in WWII, like the Garand, the 1911A1 automatic pistol, the 1903A3 rifle.  I'm afraid I don't know if any other countries used it, however: I think a blued finish was the most common elsewhere. <br />Even though the patents have long expired, the Parker Company still exists, and has a [website](https://www.parkerhq.com/about-us)<br />Angier, R.

    "question_text": "When the joint-stock company was first invented, was there a lot of pushback on the concept? What were some of the concerns?  Also any recommended books on the invention of the concept would be much appreciated!",
    "answer1": "An early form of joint stock ventures appeared in Assyria by the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE. There does not seem to have been any noticeable pushback against the concept, although trade caravans were often taxed heavily. Of course, the relevant texts were written to and from people engaged in trade, so there's no way of knowing what other Assyrians thought of long distance trade. <br />>Most of these traders had become more independent by having become managers of a \"joint-stock fund\" (called *naruqqum*, \"money bag\"), usually set up in Assur. This phenomenon appeared for the first time around 1900 BC and seems to have been an Old Assyrian invention that went beyond individual partnerships and cooperation in a joint caravan. The arrangement, rather similar to that of the early medieval *compagnia*, meant enlisting a number (usually about a dozen) of investors (*ummiānum*, \"financiers\"), who supplied capital rated in gold, usually in all ca. 30 kilos, ideally consisting of shares of 1 or 2 kilos of gold each. It was entrusted to a trader (the tractator), usually for ca. ten years, for the generally formulated purpose of \"carrying out trade.\" The contract contained stipulations on a final settlement of accounts, on paying dividends, on the division of the expected profit, and on fines for premature withdrawal of capital (meant to secure the duration of the business). Investors or shareholders mostly lived in Assur, but successful traders in Anatolia too invested in funds managed by others, perhaps also as a way of sharing commercial risks. In such cases a contract would to be drawn up in Anatolia that obliged the tractator \"to book in Assur x gold in his joint stock fund in the investor's name.\" Among the investors we find members of the tractator's family, but also business relations and others, probably a kind of \"merchant-bankers,\" and other rich citizens, who aimed at fairly safe, long-term investments.<br />[\"Ancient Assur: The City, its Traders, and its Commercial Network\"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25651212) by Klaas Veenhof<br />For more on Old Assyrian trade and these early joint stock funds, see [*Ancient Kanesh: A Merchant Colony in Bronze Age Anatolia*](https://books.google.com/books?id=qXGgCgAAQBAJ) by Mogens Larsen.",
    "answer2": "There was definitely some pushback when the joint-stock company was first invented. Some people were concerned that it would lead to corruption and cronyism, while others were worried that it would concentrate too much power in the hands of a few people. Recommended books on the topic include The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt by T.J.

Would one or both of these have been fictional stories told as jokes? Might Lincoln have taken the story from Madison? Or was this a common way that these job seekers asked for stuff?",
    "answer1": "It is possible that Madison and Lincoln were both telling jokes, as it is common for politicians to tell stories to make a point.

But Jackson wanted a bureaucracy loyal to him, correctly saw that rewarding office seekers with positions was a way to gain political support in their regions, and was quick to terminate people in order to get it. By Lincoln's administration, it was very much expected that a there would be a major turnover in positions coming in with his election, so your story was certainly a joke- a wry one, as Lincoln had plenty of men hanging about the White House getting in his way, hoping for just such a chance.  But the joke had a point, both for Madison and Lincoln- there had to be a quid pro quo, as the office seeker was expected to bring some local influence, bring the support of a Congressman, an electoral district; something useful. A man without influence might well only be able to beg for a pair of pants.<br />Real civil service reform was begun by Garfield, and after he was shot by an office seeker, carried on to everyone's surprise by  Chester A.

    "question_text": "Has there been any battles in history where both sides were completely and mutually destroyed?",
    "answer1": "In normal conditions, this would not happen, since casualty rates in historical battles are rarely that extreme. In ancient warfare the defeated side might incur something like 10-20% casualties unless things went disastrously wrong. In modern warfare a unit that has lost more than 30% effectives is considered unfit for action.<br />Most of the time, the deciding factor is morale. Warriors simply aren't going to keep on fighting when they see their buddies falling left and right and they see no way of turning things around. They're going to try to get out of there, find a place of safety, and regroup if they can; or they're going to surrender. When the situation is hopeless, most armies will give up the fight, and this will happen long before they come anywhere near total annihilation. In fact, in premodern warfare the great majority of casualties were sustained when the side that broke first was fleeing from the battlefield with the victorious side in hot pursuit.<br />So, given these conditions, what would you need to achieve mutual destruction? You'd need two sides that were roughly evenly matched and utterly determined never to give up. The necessary attitude may sometimes be found among the last defenders of a town or fortress, but of course you would never get two such forces fighting each other; in most cases where one side is prepared to fight to the end, the other side is vastly superior and not similarly inclined. The result would be either the annihilation of the defenders or the flight of the attackers - never mutual destruction.<br />There is one case from Greek history that meets your requirements, though, by virtue of being artificially created and utterly exceptional: the so-called Battle of the Champions, fought around 550 BC between the Spartans and the Argives (Herodotos 1.82). When the two armies met, they agreed to settle their dispute over a border region by each choosing 300 champions, and letting those men fight it out. It seems these picked forces were a match for each other, because all 600 men died, except for two Argives and one Spartan. At that point the two Argives left the battlefield and declared themselves victorious. The Spartan stayed behind, stripped the dead of their armour, and declared himself victorious. <br />There is no other example of a prearranged battle like this in Greek history. The reason is obvious: it was a complete failure, since the two sides couldn't agree on who had won, and in the end they decided to launch their whole armies into an all-out battle anyway. But because of the artificial conditions and the dedication of the 600 champions, it's the closest a battle ever got to complete destruction on both sides.",
    "answer2": "There have been a few instances in history where both sides in a battle were completely and mutually destroyed. One example is the Battle of Cannae during the Second Punic War, in which the Carthaginian forces led by Hannibal annihilated a much larger Roman army.

    "answer2": "I mean, it was definitely not intentional, but as Confederate armies retreated from the banks of the Mississippi, along which some of the South's wealthiest and largest plantations were located, the Union was left guarding an enormous expanse, filled with tens of thousands of freedmen that desperately needed food, medicine and clothing. This created a giant humanitarian crisis that the Union Army was ill-equipped to handle. Their best attempts were to put the freedmen into \"Contraband Camps\" that were rife with disease and unsanitary conditions. Another approach was to lease abandoned and confiscated plantations to Northern factors, who would then employ the freedmen to grow cotton. But in any case the crisis was never completely solved, and it proved to be a constant drain in Union resources and manpower, an embarrassment for the Lincoln administration, and a military factor in that the need to patrol the territory diverted thousands of troops and occasionally had adverse effects in military operations. <br />However, this was not an intentional ploy on the part of the Confederates. If they had gotten their way the Union would never have occupied those territories, and the people they enslaved would have remained in their plantations under their control. The freedmen who remained and thus came under Union protection did so not because of the Confederates but in spite of them, as they refused to flee with their masters. Instead, they abandoned the plantations and entered Union lines, or alternately, knowing that the Union would soon take control of the plantation, remained there, defying attempts to \"refugee\" them. Moreover, most of the outrage in reaction of the terrible conditions in the camps came from Northern abolitionists - people the Southerners despised.",

    "answer1": "The term \"metal road/metaled road\" is used to describe an improved road surface that is made up of compacted materials like gravel, stone, or pavement. This type of road surface is typically found in areas with high traffic volume or in locations where the natural soil conditions are not suitable for a paved road. In some cases, metal roads can also refer to roads that are coated with a layer of asphalt or other bituminous materials. <br />The term \"metal road\" is believed to have originated in the early 19th century, when roads were first being improved with compacted materials like gravel and stone. At that time, the use of metal (usually iron or steel) was also becoming more common in road construction, as it was used to reinforce the roadbed or to create drainage ditches alongside the road. Over time, the term \"metal road\" came to be used as a general term for any improved road surface, regardless of the materials used. <br />Today, the term \"metal road/metaled road\" is still used in many parts of the world, particularly in Britain, to describe an improved road surface. In some cases, the term is used interchangeably with \"paved road\" or \"tarred road.\" However, in other cases, it may be used to specifically describe a road that is made up of compacted materials like gravel or stone, or a road that is coated with a layer of asphalt or other bituminous material.",

I was wondering if there is any compiled lists of this medieval thirst poetry or what are some more famous examples of it?",
    "answer1": "Yes, this was absolutely a thing – and a reasonably widespread thing at that. Quite a lot of medieval religious women practiced aversion of mystical theology which incorporated a significant erotic element. This tended to revolve around casting Jesus as a bridegroom figure, with whomthe mystic envisioned themselves achieving spiritual, mystical union with. It’s worth noting that it was by no means only women practicing this kind of spiritual experience. Indeed, one of the most prominent examples of this practice is St Bernard of Clairvaux’s (1090-1153) sermons on the Song of Songs, in which he makes use of strongly sexualised imagery to describe union with Christ (and then promptly chastises his audience for their dirty minds – good consistentapproach there Bernard, A+).<br />However, it’s certainly the women who are the most famous for this practice, and it does seem to have been a largely female (andcertainly feminised) form of mysticism. To the best of my knowledge, there’s not a compiled list, simply because there’s a huge amount of the stuff. Poetry is prominent, but there’s also many prose accounts of mystical visions and experiences. There is an (important) caveat that the actual writer of these experiences can differ – in some cases it is the mystic herself, but in many other it’s a male (usually mendicant) confessor or spiritual director. This can be a very significant filter on the voice that we can access, and can play a part in homogenising or “flattening” the texts.<br />In terms of the content, “thirst poetry” is an interesting modern analogy, but it’s important to remember that the erotic content of works like this is (at least theoretically) very much the means to the end, which is complete and total union with the divine. Much mystical theology works in an apophatic way – this means that God is conceptualised as the ultimate negative, completely unknown and unknowable. Due to this fundamentally unreachable nature, a variety of intellectual strategies are employed to try and bridge this epistemological gap, of which the use of the erotic mode of expression is just one. It’s also worth noting that one could quite equally look at some of this “erotic” language and categorise it as being about violent behaviour instead. See for example Beatrice of Nazareth’s description of love:<br />*“Meantime, when love acts in the heart so vehemently and riotously, it becomes so excessive and exuberant in the soul that the soul thinks its heart has been wounded in many and grave ways.... So it seems that its veins are opened and its blood is boiling out, its marrow is withered and its legs are weak, its chest burns and its throat is dry.... And the soul thus feels love acting riotously within it, sparing nothing, uncontrollably seizing and consuming everything within the soul like a devouring fire…”*<br />Or Mechthild of Magdeburg’s description of the union with the Godhead:<br />*“She is captured in the first experience*  <br />*When God kisses her in sweet union.*  <br />*She is assailed with many a holy thought*  <br />*That she not waver when she mortifies her flesh.*  <br />*She is bound by the power of the Holy Spirit,*  <br />*And her bliss is indeed manifold.*  <br />*She is slapped with the great powerlessness*  <br />*Of not being able to enjoy without interruption eternal light”*<br />I’m not saying these works are *about* violence specifically, just that they’re not either uncomplicatedly erotic, or using eroticism as the primary meaning of the text.<br />Famous examples – probably the most widely known these days are Margery Kempe (experiencing something of a renaissance recently) and St Catherine of Siena. Examples do, however, multiply - Dorothea of Montau, Marguerite Porete, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch of Antwerp – the list goes on. I’d suggest that Kempe and St Catherine are probably the easiest to find editions of the complete text, though I’d not swear to that.<br />If you want some good reading on the subject, a classic text is C. Walker-Bynum, *Fragmentation and Redemption* (New York: Zone Books, 1992). A broader (and possibly more accessible) work is E. A. Petroff (ed), *Medieval Women’s Visionary Literature*, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986). There is a wealth of more recent writing on the topic, but those are good starting points.<br />Edit: formatting. Jesus, reddit.",
