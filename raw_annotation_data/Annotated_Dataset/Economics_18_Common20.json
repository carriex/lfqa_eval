    "answer1": "One of the main reasons why currencies can't change their value to be in line with other currencies is because of the different economic conditions in different countries. For example, Japan has a much stronger economy than the Central African Republic, so the Japanese Yen is worth more than the Central African Franc. If all currencies were worth the same, then it would be very difficult for people to trade goods and services between different countries.",
    "answer2": "They can, but that would require effort by someone. If, for example, someone wanted JPY to be equal to one USD they would have to buy lots and lots of JPY and pay for it with USD. And I mean LOTS.  <br />Central banks sometimes do this, for example the central bank of Denmark holds the Danisk Krone (DKK) at a fixed rate (not 1 to 1, but a still a fixed rate) relative to the Euro (EUR).<br />This is expensive, tedious, and there isn't really much point so almost nobody bothers with it. Denmark does it because they wanted to keep the DKK while still being part of the EU, and that was the compromise they reached.",

    "answer1": "The concept of money is a human invention, not a natural occurrence. Money is an abstract idea that represents a unit of exchange. It is a tool that we use to buy and sell goods and services.<br /><br />The value of money is based on trust. People trust that money will retain its value over time, and that it can be used to purchase goods and services. Money is also a store of value, meaning it can be saved and used in the future.<br /><br />The supply of money is limited. Central banks can print more money, but this can cause inflation, which reduces the value of money. Money is also a scarce resource, which is why we use it as a unit of exchange.<br /><br />There are different types of money, including fiat money, commodity money, and cryptocurrency. Fiat money is money that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver. Commodity money is money that is backed by a physical commodity. Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography to secure its transactions.",
    "answer2": "The US uses a Fiat Currency and its value is derived from the supply and demand for it like anything else.<br />Governments can and do print money. Theoretically they could print money to pay for all government services, so why don't they?<br />The answer is inflation. The more money in circulation the less its overall value.<br />Ever see a loaf of bread go for $1000? You can, and you will!<br />Post WW2 German and several African nations are examples of extreme inflation, where the government kept printing money but it crippled its value. So while it helped in the short term to fix their problems, printing money eventually caused the money to be worth less than toilet paper.",

I'm not a U.S. citizen, but the whole thing going on on [Louis Rossman's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpC4IGAkgok) (who runs the Right to Repair movement, but also makes video about the ridiculousness of New York real estate) intrigues me. <br />You see hundreds upon hundreds vacant stores 'for rent', while they still ask the same ridiculous prices (up to $55,000 a month for a store). Rossman has seen stores that have been vacant and for rent for literally over 5 years, while te price stays the same. <br />What do real estate brokers gain from this? Do they just hope that \\*someone\\* jumps the boat and deny that prices are too high? Enlighten me :)",

    "question_text": "How the tax rates are determined by governments? I would assume that governments estimate the amount of extra money they need to finance public healthcare, pensions, infrastructure improvements, etc. They make the projection for the coming years, add some safety gap on top and then calculate the tax rate based on this required amount of extra income. Is that true?<br />If so, such calculation leads us to a flat tax rate. If we are talking about a progressive tax, how are the decisions about tax bands and rates for each band made?",
    "answer1": "Governments use a variety of methods to determine tax rates. In some cases, rates are set based on the amount of money the government needs to raise to fund specific programs or initiatives. In other cases, tax rates may be based on a percentage of income, with higher earners paying a higher rate. Additionally, some governments use a progressive tax system, in which tax rates increase as income increases.",
    "answer2": "You'd be wrong.<br />The legislature gets input from economic calculations, in the US from the Congressional Budget Office, but more often than not the numbers are chosen to send political messages.<br />There are very, very few flat tax systems.  Almost all systems are extremely progressive, what's the point of collecting taxes from some poor person who you make social safety net payments to?  That would just be government using taxes to collect its own money.  Tax bands are set politically, trading off the influence of the rich with the influence of the anti-rich.  (poor ≠ anti-rich)  Poor people have little money; whereas anti-rich people don't want other people to have as much money as they already have.",

    "answer2": "There are a few reasons why the inflation rate is not 20% despite the fact that 20% of all US dollars were printed in the last year. First, it takes time for new money to enter the economy and start circulating. Second, not all of the new money will end up being used to purchase goods and services; some of it may be saved or used to pay off debt, for example.

Basically, the government sells a bond to someone, and after a set amount of time that bond can be redeemed for it's face value, and with interest. The functional value of a bond is built entirely on the value of the government (or company) that backs the bond; if that government is perceived as stable, then the bond retains value, because there's a perception that the bond will be paid when it comes due.<br />In turn, bonds are an investment. They're, generally, slightly better than cash, entirely because bonds grow in face value over time, whereas cash does not.",
    "answer2": "Yes they do. Example is America borrowing from China. What happens is America issues bonds. When someone purchases a bond they are essentially lending there money for a specified amount of time. (In bond language it’s called a term).

    "answer1": "It is actually the inflation's side effect.<br />The money worth less than the paper they paint it on. So, they use a higher number.<br />You can see how it begins (again) in Turkish Lira. In 2007, Turkey removed 6 zeroes from the money (ie 10 million TLs become 10 TLs). The $/TL was something like 1.20.<br />Now, $/TL is 8.65. TL loses it's worth. <br />To somewhat counter that, countries issue higher bills. So that the minimum wages can keep up against the inflation and people can afford basic stuff like electricity bills and such.",
    "answer2": "There are a few reasons why some countries might choose to measure their currency in large units. One reason is that it can help to combat inflation. When prices are rising rapidly, it can be difficult to keep track of the value of goods and services if the currency is divided into small units. It can also be difficult to make change for small purchases. If the currency is measured in larger units, it can be easier for people to keep track of the value of goods and services and to make change. Another reason for using large units of currency is that it can make transactions more efficient. For example, if you are buying a car for $1,000, it is more efficient to pay in one $1,000 bill than to pay in ten $100 bills. Finally, large units of currency can also make it easier to track money laundering and other illicit financial activities. If all transactions are conducted in large units of currency, it can be easier to track the flow of money and to identify suspicious activity.",

    "answer2": "Hyper inflation occurs when people, lenders, foreign companies e.t.c lose confidence in the currency. <br />If I'm a shop owner and I usually sell an apple for 1 coin. However I'm not convinced in a month I'll be able to buy myself enough food/pay rent e.t.c by selling apples for 1 coin. So I raise my prices today to protect myself against currency changes in the future. This of course spirals out of control because everyone starts doing this.<br />Because the value is changing fast, there is no point saving money, so everyone tries to spend all their money at once before it's value is rapidly eroded to zero. Often money will be spent the same day it is earned - and everyone spending every penny every day pushes up prices more and the cycle continues. <br />The only way to fix the issue is to make people trust the currency again. This is usually done by adopting a stable foreign currency or pegging your currency to a foreign currency. (Brazil effectively stopped hyperinflation).",

    "question_text": "How do credit/debit cards work? What is the process of putting money in and getting it out? ",
    "answer1": "A credit or debit card is basically just an easy way to allow a shop to speak to your bank.<br />First you go into the bank, and you either deposit some cash into your account (debit), or you ask the bank nicely to cover you, and promise that you will pay them back at the end of the month (credit).<br />Then you can go shopping. You get to the till with your products, which you now need to pay for, but instead of handing over cash directly, you ask the shop to deal directly with your bank. The shop phones up the bank and asks them to take X amount of money out of your account, then nip over to the shops own bank and give it to them on your behalf, which they do.<br />That is pretty much how a credit or debit card works, just automated with computers...",
    "answer2": "Debit cards are linked to a bank account and whenever you pay using a debit card, the amount is deducted from the bank account on completion of the transaction. So, instead of withdrawing and handing over cash for a purchase, you can swipe the card.<br />Credit cards come with a credit limit and a defined billing cycle (generally monthly). So, you can make purchases using the credit card upto the defined credit limit. The bill is generated as per the defined billing cycle and you are required to settle it just like the bills for any other utilities.<br />Hope this helps.",

    "question_text": "There is all this talk about global USD shortage despite trillions that were printed in the last 2 years, what gives? ",
    "answer1": "If you go back in time prior to 1990 most of the world's debt is denominated in the local currency of the country where the debt was made.  So if I'm an Indian oil refiner and I want to get a loan to build a new plant, I go to a bank and get a loan that I have to pay back in Indian Rupees.  Similarly, if I'm the government of Vietnam and I want to get a loan to build a new highway, I'll go to a bank and get a loan that needs to be paid back in Vietnamese Dong (no they're not cutting people's penises off, that's what the currency there is called).<br />The problem with this is that most of the loans that are being made to countries outside of the US/EU/Japan are being made by the US/EU/Japan.  Countries outside of that area are also incredibly corrupt.  So what happens when the Vietnamese government can't afford to pay back its loan?  It prints a shitload of Dong and uses the freshly printed currency to pay off its debt.  Because of how many Dong have been printed to satisfy this debt, the value of the Dong collapses and the lender is left with a pile of worthless currency.<br />The solution that lenders in the US/EU/Japan came up with for this problem was to make it so that borrowers outside of those regions have to pay back their loans in dollars.  Now it doesn't matter how much the Vietnamese government devalues its currency - it still has to pay back the same amount of dollars.  <br />Most corporate/national debt is made in the form of 20 or 30 year bonds.  In a 20 year bond you make a small interest payment each year.  Then, at the end of the 20 years, you pay back *the entirety of what you were initially loaned*.  <br />So imagine you take a $100 loan, paid back over 20 years with an interest rate of 1%.  Each year you pay the lender $1 (1% of $100).  Then on year 20 you pay $101 (the original $100 value of the loan plus your final interest payment).  That means that to make your debt payment for year 20, you need 101 times as many dollars as you did to make your payment in year 19.<br />Right now all of the early dollar denominated loans to the third world are starting the hit that point where the borrowers need to make that big, final payment.  That's causing a sudden surge in the need for companies and governments to get dollars.  <br />You can view the China Evergrande situation as being a direct result of this.  Evergrande needs to make the final payment on a lot of its 20/30 year bonds right now.  It has physical assets with a sufficient value to do this (it owns a lot of land and buildings).  The problem is it can't hand the buildings to its creditors because of Chinese government restrictions on foreign land ownership.  It needs to sell the buildings to get dollars to pay off its loans.  But it needs so many dollars so quickly that its hard to find people that have that many dollars at once.",
    "answer2": "There are a few different factors at play here. First, the US dollar is still considered the global reserve currency, meaning that it is used more than any other currency for international transactions. This means that demand for dollars is always high, even when there is a lot of them in circulation.<br /><br />Second, the trillions of dollars that were printed in the last two years were mostly used to bail out banks and other financial institutions. This money never actually made it into the hands of consumers, so it didn't really increase the overall money supply.<br /><br />Lastly, the global economy is still recovering from the last recession, and many countries are still dealing with high levels of debt. This means that there is less demand for USD-denominated assets, and that the dollar is under more pressure than it has been in recent years.",

Now, that same €40K BMW only costs $40k in the US. Demand for a $40k BMW will be higher than the demand for the same car if it costs $50k. So there will be more demand for BMW exports.
