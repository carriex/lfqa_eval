    "answer1": "Proving an allegation of that level of severity would require a lot of strong evidence; if you jail someone over it before you have that evidence ready, you risk utterly botching the investigation or subsequent court proceedings and having the person walk away on technicalities. Given the number of defendants charged/arrested/facing trial/convicted, it's likely quite a few of them have been/will add more information through interrogation/interview that will potentially build up evidence as well. When you're talking about 500+ defendants, it's going to take a while to sort through everything they say and corroborate/disprove things.<br />This applies especially when the people concerned are high-ranking public figures are involved, or wealthy citizens who can afford top notch legal support, and when a misstep could end up further fueling political violence/extremism.<br />Federal prosecutors in particular tend not to file charges/order an arrest until they are absolutely certain a conviction will occur.",

For an arrest to be made, there has to be probable cause for an arrest to be made. Most of those citizens that were involved in the January 6th insurrection had their faces concealed, and it would be nearly impossible to find and convict those individuals. If law enforcement were actively present and arresting people at the location of the insurrection, it would provide better evidence for an arrest and a POSSIBLE conviction. ",

    "question_text": "Why do people on death row stay there for months or even years before being executed? ",
    "answer1": "basically because of so called liberals. recently the prolific serial killer Rodney Alcala(creepiest person ever) died on death row in California at age 77. im sure he was warm and safe when he died.",
    "answer2": "Because the idea of the death penalty comes with an assumption that, since it is the ultimate punishment, it can never be allowed to happen to an innocent person. During the inmate's stay an extensive and expensive investigation is performed to ensure in absolute certainty there is no shade of doubt that this person actually did what they're being executed for.<br />If you want to see what happens when this process is NOT implemented, look into the case of John Christie and Timothy Evans.<br />In Great Britain, in January 1950, Timothy Evans turned himself in to the police, claiming he had accidentally caused the death of his wife by giving her medicine that was supposed to cause a miscarriage - Evans' wife got pregnant again soon after the birth of their daughter and the two could not afford the second child and abortion was illegal at the time. Evans claimed to have initially panicked, hid the body in a nearby sewer, gave his daughter to relatives, and tried to flee the country, but then, overcame with guilt, has turned himself in.<br />Police arrived in the sewer where Evans claimed to have hidden the body and not only didn't find any but realized a single man could not open the hatch to get down, as it took two officers to lift. Pressed Evans admitted to omitting the truth - he wasn't the one who gave his wife the medicine, it was his downstairs neighbour, John Christie. Christia informed Evans of the tragedy and convinced him it would be better if he disappeared for some time so no one connects him to his wife's death. Christie said he will hid the body in the sewers and make his relatives take care of Evans' daughter. Evans was covering him out of gratitude, understanding his wife's death was an accident.<br />Christie denied everything and suggested Evans may have hidden the body in the small garden adjacent to their apartment complex - he has found a part of it where it seems someone uprooted the earth. Quickly digging the cops found bodies of Evans' wife and daughter, both strangled.<br />Pressed again Evans signed a testimony admitting to having murdered his wife and child but later claimed he was forced to do it under threats of violence. In the court, he tried to accuse Christie but as someone who already has changed his testimony multiple times and had a shady past, his word could not stand to the word of respected former police officer Christie was. Evans was found guilty and executed in March of 1950.<br />In 1953 Christie moved out of his apartment. The new tenant immediately began renovating the place. And behind wallpaper in the kitchen found the bodies of three women. After informing the police someone looked into Evans' case and realized they never searched the whole garden, despite reports of dogs finding human bones in it. They never bothered to ask how Evans accessed a garden only Christie had the key to. They never looked into reports of Christie's violent behavior, including an assault on a woman. Digging through the garden revealed more bodies, from before and after Evans' case. Christie was apprehended and among his possessions was a newspaper clip of Evans being found guilty, as if it was something he was proud of.<br />John Christie was put on trial and found guilty of the murder of at least 8 women but the story doesn't end there. His sentencing made people question whenever Evans was not innocent and just framed by Christie. At the time government of Britain was very supportive of the death penalty and argued there is no way such a sentence would be accidentally performed on an innocent person. To avoid losing face the government called not one but two committees that both tried to claim they believe Evans was indeed guilty. Of course, it was a lie as no one would believe two people were living next to each other, killing the same type of victims at the same time and hiding them in the same spot and somehow did not notice each other. Meaning that defending the death penalty caused the spread of corruption among government officials of all levels. the case made a mockery of justice and is seen as one of the reasons why Great Britain abolished the death penalty.",

For instance, if a great majority of the doctors in your country are well-trained, and they think epidemiologists are the best at knowing how to handle disease outbreaks, and they think that, say, Anthony Fauci is the best viral epidemiologist out there, then it might be reasonable to accept his advice on the subject as persuasive.",

    "answer1": "A filibuster is a parliamentary procedure where debate on a bill is extended, essentially preventing a vote from taking place. This can be done by any senator, and in the past, it was used as a way to stall civil rights legislation. Nowadays, it's often used as a tactic to delay or prevent a vote on a bill, or to force the Senate to reach a 60-vote supermajority.",
    "answer2": "Originally, senators debated bills or confirmations. A senator can speak as long as he wants in this debate, and in the past they spoke for days to delay a bill, even reading from a phone book to pass the time. That's a filibuster. The rest of the Senate can shut him up with 60 votes to allow debate to continue (cloture). The Senate could only consider one bill at a time, so this held up the entire work of the Senate, even stopped the people of the same party from getting their bills heard. Filibusters were very politically expensive and individually exhausting, so they didn't happen much. <br />Over the years this has evolved. Back in the 1970s the Democrats allowed two legislative tracks, making it less politically expensive. The number of filibusters shot up after that. It eventually involved into not having to actually speak, and now any senator can stall a bill simply by saying so.

    "answer1": "Several reasons<br />It sends a signal as to how severe the crime is. The justice system is telling us that this person did stuff bad enough to be incarcerated for more than the rest of their life.<br />It helps the victims and survivors to see that the crime against them has been recognized. If you have a single \"life\" sentence for someone that killed four people, the families of those four people are just seeing it as a single crime. However, 25 years for each adding to a hundred years in total acknowledges them as four individual crimes. There's perhaps a little more comfort in that, and a sense of justice served.<br />And it helps make more informed decisions about the possibility of parole or clemency in the future. Dude got a life sentence? Maybe 20 years served is enough. Dude got a 1000 year sentence? They ain't EVER getting out.",
    "answer2": "This is mostly an issue in states where prison sentences can stack upon each other. 5 years for three robberies make 15 years in total. This is not done in many states as far as I am aware. <br />E.g. most states in the european union take all charges known into a single court trial and get a prison sentence out covering all charges into one. <br />Also many european countries have a max-lifetime sentence which cannot be extend under normal circumstances. E.g. in germany its 15 years IIRC. Which is a fairly significant span of your life.<br />Because longer prison sentences do not stop crime in large, nor do they help with the reintegration of criminals into society. Something most modern justice systems try to achieve. Instead they just cost money, lead to overcrowed prisons and offer little to no benefit for society at large.",

Each state is different and a life sentence may be different from state to state. For example someone murders 3 people and giving a life sentence of all 3 people. In order for that person to be eligible for parole, the defendant may need to serve at least 20 years of that sentence. In this example, since it is 3 separate charges, the defendant wouldn't be eligible until 60 years of serving the sentence. https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/why-judges-hand-multiple-life-sentences.html",

If I stopped paying rent, I can't just stay and live there forever for free? So what am I not understanding about adverse possession? Hypothetically, if I trekked onto someone's private acreage and was able to go undetected for a set amount of time, that land could just become mine after long enough? Doesn't make sense!",
    "answer1": "Sovereign citizens and Moorish Americans would like you to believe that you can claim property by just squatting for a few years, but 99% of the time that is not the case, and you'll end up in jail. And if you forged a lease agreement, like so many do, you'll be going to federal prison. *That's the bad one where dropping the soap is a thing.*",
    "answer2": "Adverse possession is a legal doctrine that allows a person to gain ownership of a piece of property through continuous, exclusive, and uninterrupted use. In order to successfully claim adverse possession, the squatting individual must meet certain requirements set forth by state law, which vary from state to state. Generally speaking, the squatter must have been using the property for a certain period of time (usually 5-20 years), in a way that is open and notorious (meaning that the owner is aware of the squatter's use of the property), and with the intent to possess the property (meaning that the squatter must have the intention of using the property as their own). If these requirements are met, the squatter may be able to gain legal ownership of the property.<br /><br />There are a few exceptions to the rule of adverse possession. For example, if the property is owned by the government or if the squatter is a tenant of the property owner, the squatter will not be able to claim adverse possession. Additionally, some states have laws that specifically prohibit adverse possession (meaning that even if the requirements are met, the squatter will not be able to gain ownership of the property).<br /><br />So, in answer to your question, yes, it is possible for a squatter to gain legal ownership of a piece of property through adverse possession. However, there are a number of requirements that must be met in order for this to happen.",

It was discovered that McDonald's was serving the coffee at the time of the incident was dangerously hot and well above the McDonald's operations manual required temperature of 180 to 190 degrees. Furthermore, it was even proved that McDonalds knew about the coffee being extremely hot and did nothing about it. So when the woman was getting the coffee from the drive though worker and the lid became loose and spilled, it caused third-degree burns to the woman and required her to seek medical attention. This woman actually attempted to settle with McDonalds by having them pay her hospital bills, but McDonalds denied it and kept counteroffering with low amounts.

    "answer1": "The Texas House Speaker can ban the word \"racism\" from being used in a legislative session by issuing a formal directive to House Members. This directive could state that the use of the word \"racism\" is prohibited in any official capacity during the session. House Members would then be required to adhere to this directive or face consequences, such as being removed from the session or being censured.<br /><br />The Speaker's ability to restrict the free speech of House Members is derived from the House's rules of order. These rules give the Speaker significant authority to regulate the conduct of Members and to enforce decorum in the chamber. While the Speaker's authority is not absolute, it is generally upheld by the House as long as the Speaker is acting in good faith and in the interest of maintaining order.<br /><br />The legality of the Speaker's actions would likely be challenged on the grounds that they violate the First Amendment right to free speech. However, the Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment does not protect all forms of speech, and that the government can place reasonable restrictions on speech in certain circumstances. It is possible that a court would find that the Speaker's actions are permissible under the First Amendment, although this is by no means certain.",

    "answer1": "There are a number of reasons why America cannot simply ban guns. First, there is the issue of the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution. The Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to keep and bear arms. This right has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to apply to individuals, and not just to militias. As a result, any attempt to ban guns would likely be unconstitutional.<br /><br />Second, there is the issue of enforcement. Even if guns were banned, there would still be a black market for them. It would be very difficult to enforce a ban on guns, and there would likely be a lot of violence associated with the black market.<br /><br />Third, there is the issue of self-defense. Many people believe that they have a right to defend themselves and their families, and that banning guns would take away that right.<br /><br />Fourth, there is the issue of hunting. Hunting is a popular sport in America, and many people believe that banning guns would take away their ability to hunt.<br /><br />Finally, there is the issue of politics.
