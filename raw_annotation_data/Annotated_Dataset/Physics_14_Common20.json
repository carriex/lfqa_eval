    "answer1": "They use thrusters, which are tiny \"rocket engines\" (sometimes they just puff gas under pressure) on the sides of the ship.  Gravity actually has little to do with it - it's the lack of air that makes aerodynamic surfaces like ailerons and rudders ineffective.",
    "answer2": "Rockets are able to steer and move in space because they rely on the force of their engines to propel them in the desired direction. Without gravity, there is nothing to pull them back down to the surface of a planet or moon, so they can continue moving in a straight line indefinitely.

One reason is that when the pitcher or carafe is full, the weight of the water can cause the spout to open slightly, which allows water to drip or spill out. Another reason is that when the container is full, the water level is higher than the spout, so the water has to travel further to reach the spout, which can cause it to spill or dribble out.

    "question_text": "Why when holding a magnifying glass in a certain angle on a sunny day causes things like wood and cotton to burn? ",
    "answer1": "Sunlight carries with it energy. About a thousand watts per square meter on a good day. A 6-cm magnifying glass takes up about 0.28% of a square meter, so it will be collecting around 2.8 watts of power - that's about a fifth of a small candle. It is concentrated down to a very small area - smaller than a candle flame, and so as far as that small area is concerned, it may as well be held over a flame.",
    "answer2": "A magnifying glass works by gathering the light from a larger area and focussing it into a smaller area. When using a magnifying glass normally, you're taking the light bouncing off the thing you're looking at and focussing it into your eye-hole.<newline>If you bring a magnifying glass outside on a sunny day, [this happens](https://i.imgur.com/sJxraPg.png). All the sunlight (and heat energy) that hits the whole large surface of the magnifying glass gets focused and concentrated to be hitting a MUCH smaller point. So like, if you focus the power onto a spot 1/100th the size of the glass itself, that spot gets 100x more heat on it than just being in normal sunlight. Also notice you're not creating energy here. The hot spot gets a shadow around it. You're just moving and gathering most of the light that would have hit the circle and redistributing it into a much smaller spot and leaving a shadow around that spot.",

    "question_text": "how does a nuclear reactor and nuclear energy work? How does a nuclear reactor and nuclear energy work?",
    "answer1": "A nuclear reactor uses radioactive materials as their fuel source. A chain reaction is started where neutrons slam into the other atoms which in turn also shoot off neutrons. But these neutrons are flying away at a high rate of speed, and they need to be slowed down a bit to make them more likely to hit another atom; this is where the moderator comes in. There are a few different things that can do this function, even just water.<newline>To control the reaction so they can make it happen more slowly over time instead of releasing all that insane energy at once, things such as control rods (which instead absorb neutrons instead of just slowing them down) are also put in the reactor.<newline>All this neutron whizzing about breaking other atoms like a cue ball on a pool table creates heat, crazy amounts of heat. This is captured via what is called the primary loop, which is water that is being circulated through the reactor both to help keep it cool and to collect that heat. This then goes to an exchanger where the primary water heats up secondary water (you don't want the primary water which is being exposed to neutron radiation to be outside the containment), and this secondary water gets turned into steam. This is what actually drives the steam turbines.<newline>Tldr: Nuclear reactions are atoms losing pieces that bump into other atoms and make them break up too, this makes shitloads of heat. The heat is collected and used for running a steam turbine.",
    "answer2": "A nuclear reactor is a device used to initiate and control a nuclear chain reaction. Nuclear reactors are used to generate electricity and to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. <newline><newline>Nuclear power plants use nuclear fission to generate electricity. In a typical nuclear power plant, uranium fuel is enriched to about 3-5% U-235 and then formed into pellets. These pellets are then placed in fuel rods, which are bundled together to form a fuel assembly. <newline><newline>The fuel assembly is placed in the reactor core, where the nuclear fission reaction takes place.

    "question_text": "Why do heavy objects fall at the same speed as light ones? Shouldn't gravity make objects which mass is greater attract each other more and therefore touch each other more quickly? Or maybe the mass of the Earth is so big that the difference between two objects in perspective is negligible, especially on the very short distance between them and the soil? Not sure... could you explain?",
    "answer1": "They do attract each other more, heavy objects fall with a greater force than light objects they just fall at the same velocity. The impact of a heavy object when it hits the ground is far greater, but force = mass times acceleration so the greater mass is balanced out by the greater force.",
    "answer2": "Physics. Terminal velocity is a thing that matters a lot more than it seems. Also weight/mass while related, are two separate factors out of many factors that affect speed of falling objects. I’m definitely no physics person, but I believe that a heavier object needs more time to get to terminal velocity even though with enough time it will ultimately have a greater pull on it due to being heavier. A smaller object will reach terminal velocity more quickly, but it won’t go as fast. These two things exist on a parabola where there’s a lot of overlap because there’s often not a large enough free fall. Example of physics, an average sized human’s free fall terminal velocity is about 85-90mph, but a streamlined human can get to well over 100, and a human wearing specific clothing/attire can get even faster in a fall. That’s a variance of 60-70mph ultimately in an object that’s the same mass/size/relatively same shape just oriented differently or otherwise affecting drag.",

    "answer1": "There are several reasons why we can't just build more nuclear power stations to reduce carbon emissions. First, nuclear power is expensive to build and maintain. Second, nuclear power plants produce radioactive waste that is difficult to dispose of safely. Finally, nuclear power plants can be potential targets for terrorist attacks.",
    "answer2": "Easy enough to do.  Nuclear has an image problem, though.  People don't like them and don't want them around, so permitting is a nightmare.  California just shut down its last nuclear plant, in fact.",

If there are 2 forces on the same object, that counteract, the object doesn't move.<br />But there was energy released to create these forces. If these forces don't cause anything to move, doesn't it mean that that energy was destroyed?",
    "answer1": "Applying perfectly opposite forces in a perfectly static and rigid world - doesn't actually expend any energy. The act of applying a force doesn't expend energy - its the act of applying a force over a distance which does.<newline>In the real world, since everything is elastic, the thing you are compressing/stretching with your forces, plus the structure that the forces are reacting against will act like stiff springs - and this is where the energy gets stored.<newline>For example press your hands together in front of your chest. As you press:<newline>* Some energy gets stored into the squishing of your palms<newline>* Some energy gets stored in the compression of the bones in your forearms<newline>* Some energy gets stored in the tension of your upper arms and the bones across your shoulders<newline>The chances are some energy will be lost to heat, since flesh is unlikely to be a particularly efficient elastic. <newline>Since you don't apply the force over much distance, very little energy is stored. If you put a spring between your hands, now you apply the force over more distance and more energy is stored (which is apparent when you let the spring go!)",

    "answer1": "The current model for what happened before the big bang is known as cosmic inflation.<newline>The basic idea is that the Big Bang on its own explains many of the observations made my scientists regarding the structure of the universe. However, what is interesting is that there are several observations that the Big Bang *cannot* explain, such as:<newline>\\- why was the universe \"born\" perfectly flat?<newline>\\- why is the universe the same temperature (up to over 99% accuracy) in all directions when there hasn't been enough time for the temperature of the universe to \"even out\" all the way?<newline>\\- why aren't there various high-energy relics (like magnetic monopoles - a magnet that's only North or South, but *not both*) when the Standard Model (the current frame work of the smallest particles in physics) predicted that such relics should exist as a result of the insanely high energy of the Big Bang?<newline>\\- why did the universe begin with such low entropy (which is a measure of \"disorder\" in a system)? Especially considering the fact that entropy always increases in closed systems?<newline>After the Big Bang model became accepted in the first half of the 1900's, scientists have struggled to answer these questions above according to the framework of the Big Bang.<newline>However, in the '70s and '80s a scientist named Alan Guth came up with a model explains everything the Big Bang did, *and* also explains the unsolved observations not accounted by the Big Bang. This model is known as cosmic inflation, and put simply it is the idea that the energy in the first moments of universe wasn't in particles or radiation, but in the fabric of space itself. So what happened *before* the Big Bang is that the fabric of space itself began to exponentially inflate to an unimaginable degree, and we call the \"Big Bang\" is actually the end of this inflationary period.<newline>So then that begs the question: what happened before the inflationary period? Sadly, no one knows. It is possible that some kind of singularity existed before inflation. It is also possible that inflation never stopped, which would imply the existence of a multiverse. Or it could be that inflations happen cyclically, which implies an eternal universe.<newline>What's really interesting here is that the scientists who figured out and basically proved that inflation came first did this forty years ago.

    "answer1": "Momentum is something that exists in mass. If you apply a force, it inherently *must* change an object's velocity (however slightly) and does not change its mass.<newline>To increase the momentum of an object, you must decrease the momentum of another object, as momentum is a conserved quantity. Note that momentum is a vector, and so a \"decrease\" could just as well mean an increase in the opposite direction. The force 'moves' momentum between the two objects.<newline>The force could, instead, move mass between the two objects, but the scenario is a bit odd, since the new mass isn't necessarily the same object but simply travels alongside the object.<newline>For example, imagine a very fast aircraft flying over enemy territory. So fast that it keeps pace with bullets. The enemy fires upon the aircraft, but the bullets can only match speeds with it and will not damage it. The bullets are now traveling with the aircraft, and with some mid-flight gluing they could become a part of it. In this case, the force of firing the bullet is pumping mass to the object without changing its velocity.",
