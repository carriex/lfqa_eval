    "question_text": ". How can some companies (Amazon, Steam, Dropbox etc...) send TERABITS of data over internet while the normal user is in MEGABITS. ",
    "answer1": "You only have 1 internet connection, and it's most likely running over copper wires. Copper has quality issues over longer distances.<br />These big companies have many many internet connections all over the world made of fiber optic cables which can transmit data for miles with no significant signal degradation. Speeds of 10 or even 100 gigabits (1 gigabit = 1,000 megabits) are very common on these lines.<br />And I do need to point out, these companies don't have all their stuff in one place, much less one country. For example if you go into Steam's settings you can in and select where you want your download to be done from. Steam has machines in all these locations, and those \"terabits\" are each location added up together. Steam's servers in Washington couldn't provide for the whole world's game download needs by themselves, but if everyone selects a location fairly close by (or the system makes reasonable guesses and auto-assigns locations) each location can be more reasonably sized.<br />So, yeah, totally doable.",
    "answer2": "TL;DR because they have money.<br />The cables and other equipment operated by your ISP are mostly physically capable of terabit speeds. Possibly the \"last mile\" connection (the cables that link your house to the rest of the street) aren't quite as capable, but more than what you're getting. Your speed is limited to megabits because you're one of many customers renting a fraction of the that total available bandwidth.<br />Companies can afford to rent a much bigger portion of that available bandwidth, rent a dedicated physical line, or have the resources to build their own infrastructure.",

    "comments": "I actually liked both Answer A and Answer B, but I particularly appreciated the direct-to-the-point and relevant response of Answer B compared to the lengthy and assumption-filled response of Answer A. \n\nOne thing that I didn't like with Answer A is its numerous assumptions that don't reflect the actual situations in the real-world. For example, the first part of its first sentence \"You only have 1 internet connection\". It is so vague on what is meant by \"1 internet connection\" and it is not really a basis over the amount of data that you can transmit over the internet as a normal user. Also, in today's technology, there are already a lot of ISPs (Internet Service Providers) who offer 1Gbps speed even to normal residential users which is unheard of in the past. Although it is not in the level of Terabits, a Gbps speed should be enough for a 'normal' user. \n\nAnother wrong assumption made by Answer A is that \"it's most likely running over copper wires\". Again, this factor is not indicative of internet speed. It is undeniable that copper wires have issues on longer distances and electronic interference, however, it is not the reason why you will have only Mbps in speed. In fact, there are articles that say that even copper-wire connection can even reach to Gbps level. (Reference:https://www.lsnetworks.net/fiber-optic-vs-copper-what-should-you-choose-for-your-business/#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20a%20copper%2Dbased,of%20up%20to%2010%20Gbps.). Also, it was wrong to assume that normal users are limited to only using copper-wire internet connection. That is simply not true in today's technology. Depending on availability in a specific city or country, ISPs now offer fiber optic internet connection even to residential or 'normal' users, not just to big companies. In summary, the reasons provided by Answer A aren't really the actual reasons why there is a limited internet speed  to 'normal' users (although the writer of the question does not specifically define what normal user means). To be fair, the statements of Answer A that refers to the advantage of fiber optic cables (no signal degradation and better speed) are all factual and accurate, depending on the ISP and internet connection plan involved. \n\nIn the next part of Answer A, it mentioned that large companies (like Amazon, Steam and Dropbox) are using multiple locations to handle their large volumes of data as mentioned in \"Steam has machines in all these locations...\". The statements are actually facts and indeed, most of the largest companies around the world use multiple datacenters in multiple locations in order to cater to their clients/users. However, this is not really exactly relevant to the question about the companies' internet consumption. Any company (even smaller ones) can have multiple datacenters and yet not consume TERABITS of data. Having multiple locations does not mean that you will have access to that amount of internet speed or consumption. \n\nAnswer B is much more simple and easy to understand than Answer A. I really liked that it directly answered the question by saying that \"because they have money\". Crude as it may sound, but it is the actual reason why some companies (and probably some lucky individuals) are able to afford a higher than average Internet speed. In the second part of Answer B, it explained that, depending on the ISP, cables and other equipment that are available to normal users are actually capable of higher speeds (as I have also mentioned on my analysis of Answer A). The only reason why normal users have limitations on their speed is because the actual line is shared with other customers as indicated on '...because you're one of many customers renting a fraction...'\n\nAnswer B summarized its statements with the last paragraph \"Companies can afford to rent a much bigger portion...\". This is the perfect answer to the question. The main reason why large companies like Amazon, Steam, etc. are able to send/receive TERABITS of data over the internet is because they have the money to afford better internet services as stated on \"...afford to rent a much bigger portion...\". All these statements are factual and reflects the actual situation for most corporate internet connections. \n\nAnswer B can be improved by removing some phrases such as the 'TL;DR' at the beginning and the '..but more than what you're getting...\" in the middle of the paragraph.

    "answer1": "There are a few reasons why a PC download size might be different than a console download size for the same game. One reason is that the PC version of a game might be more graphically demanding than the console version, and thus require more data to be downloaded. Another reason is that the PC version of a game might include more content than the console version - for example, extra levels, bonus features, etc. Finally, it's also possible that the PC version of a game is simply a higher-quality version than the console version, and thus requires more data to be downloaded.",
    "answer2": "Primarily because of the varying settings. All xboxes or all ps5s or whatever console are all fairly uniform in every part of their hardware except maybe overall harddrive space. They process things all the same way so there's no need to account for variance. PCs vary so much in processing power and capabilities that you'd more likely have trouble finding two that are exactly the same. <br />The game producers have to account for this by creating a game that looks nice enough that it doesn't appear to be outdated, but keep requirements low enough that users with lower end PCs can still run them even if they have to change the graphics settings to do so. If they don't do this then they run the risk of alienating one group or the other and missing out on potential profit",

    "comments": "Both Answer A and Answer B have given relevant responses to the question, however, Answer B is a bit confusing compared to the well-structured response of Answer A.\n\nAnswer B is already quite confusing starting from its first statement \"...Primarily because of the varying settings.\" My first thought was to ask why would settings dictate the download size for PC and consoles. However, Answer B did clarify this statement on its succeeding statements, mentioning that PCs and consoles have varied hardware and processing capabilities as stated in \"...PCs vary so much in processing power...\". I do agree with these statements, and they are actually factual, however, it is not a clear reason why there would be a difference in the PC and console versions of the same game. I do think that Answer B has a point in saying that game producers have to account for the gap between the capacities of PCs and consoles but the way the answer was constructed was confusing and not well-structured.\n\nThe second paragraph of Answer B is even more confusing than the first paragraph, and it felt as if the two sections don't even match each other. In the first paragraph, Answer B stated that there is a difference between the capabilities of PCs and consoles but this was not elaborated on the second paragraph. Instead of directly stating that perhaps PC games have  a higher download size than console download size, the paragraph moved to another focus by talking about \"keep requirements low enough...\". There was no definite answer nor conclusion to the statements given in Answer B. \n\nAnother thing that I didn't like on Answer B is the assumption made on the second sentence \"All xboxes or all ps5s...are all fairly uniform...\". This is definitely not factual particularly for consoles with different developers/manufacturers. It is incorrect to assume that the settings for ALL consoles is the same for ALL games.  \n\nCompared to Answer B, Answer A has presented a more structured explanation of the answer by listing down a number of reasons as to why PC download size might be different than the console download size. The reasons enumerated are all factual and realistic. They were also explained in a simple and clear way. I do agree on the first reason that PC versions have more graphical capabilities (\"graphically demanding...\") than console versions resulting to more than double the file size of the game. I was researching games for the Nintendo Switch and PC games (Reference: https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-switch-games-biggest-file-size-gb/ and https://gamerant.com/pc-games-file-size-hd-space-biggest-huge/) and it was fairly obvious about their gap. This reason can be improved by rephrasing it as \"One reason is that the PC version of a game can handle highly-detailed graphics and effects than the console version, thus requiring more data to be downloaded.\"\n\nThe second reason \"PC version of a game might include more content...\" is bit of 50/50 however. Although PC versions of games do have more flexibility in terms of additional content, we cannot discount the fact that even console games have extra DLC (Downloadable Content) although not on the same size as PC ones. The second reason can be rephrased as \"Another reason is that the PC version of a game has more flexibility in terms of additional content compared to the console version. Downloadable content such as extra levels, bonus features and PC-only events usually have a higher download size as compared to console ones.\"\n\nThe third reason is quite subjective \"PC version of a game is simply a higher-quality version than the console version\". There is no proof or evidence to conclude that PC versions are better than the console ones, it is a question depending on the preferences of the user/gamer. As part of improving Answer A, this third reason should be removed. \n\nIn summary, both Answer A and Answer B provided valuable insights about the difference between the download size of PC and console versions of the same game. From research, PC games do have the highest download size, followed by console and then by mobile games. The main reason for this difference in download size is that PC games can afford to have more graphics/effects compared to console games. And Answer A has explained this effectively. ",

    "answer1": "Yes, an older computer can affect performance.

Additionally, over time, an older computer can accumulate dust and other debris, which can also impede performance.",
    "answer2": "An older computer is less powerful than devices sold today.

    "comments": "Both Answer A and Answer B provided sufficient factual answers to the question. However, the  explanation provided with Answer A is much simpler and easier to understand. \n\nAnswer B started its explanation by comparing older computers with newer devices through the statement 'An older computer is less powerful...'. This immediately establishes the premise that older computers might not be able to keep up with the growth of applications and websites \"Applications and websites grow...\". These statements are factual and reflect the actual situation in the real-world use of computers. \n\nHowever, the facts mentioned in the first paragraph of Answer B was not supplemented by the second paragraph. Suddenly, Answer B shifted its focus on software, particularly \"old installation of software...\". In re-reading the question \"Does older computer affect performance? Like a computer that i have use for 5 years\", it can be inferred that the question is referring to an old machine/device, rather than the software inside it. That is why, in my opinion, the whole second paragraph is irrelevant and strays away from the real purpose of the question. It was unnecessary to discuss about the reasons for disk fragmentation, reinstalling of OS, etc. because the question pertains to a more generalized performance issue when it comes to older computers. \n\nThe third paragraph of Answer B is vague and misleading, and can be considered as an assumption. It is incorrect to say that \"As long as the computer works without errors, its actual performance will not degrade\". And even though Answer B follows it up with a disclaimer of \"But we usually demand more of it.\" it might give readers an impression that older computers will not have a degraded performance if you don't demand more of it. Which is not true. Regardless whether you demand less or more of it, an old computer/device will experience performance reduction in its latter years. Experts and references (https://www.bustle.com/p/when-is-it-time-to-buy-a-new-computer-these-are-the-tell-tale-signs-you-need-to-say-goodbye-6457626) say that most computers/laptops have a lifespan of 3-5 years and during these years, performance will slowly degrade. This means that computers, no matter how you use or maintain them, have a finite lifespan. \n\nThe last paragraph of Answer B talks about heat damage \"It is possible for parts to be damaged by heat\". Although it was not phrased nor introduced properly, overheating issue is actually one of the signs that a computer is near its end of lifespan. Most older computers accumulate dust/dirt over time and this can affect the performance of its hardware. Also, older computers cannot usually handle CPU-intensive applications and when it attempts to run them, it causes the computer to heat up faster. Answer B would have been better if it just skipped the second paragraph and instead, focused on the hardware issues that might affect the performance of an older computer. \n\nI chose Answer A as the better answer primarily because it was simple, direct-to-the-point, well-constructed and easy to understand compared to Answer B. The first statement of Answer A directly responded to the question by \"Yes, an older computer can affect performance.\" The statement is factual and based on realistic situations. It is true that older computers, particularly 5-year or more ones (as indicated in the question), have degraded performance and will not be able to be up to par with the latest devices. \n\nCompared with Answer B's shifting focus on multiple topics, Answer A provided examples that will support its first statement. The statement \"For example, an older computer may have a slower processor, less memory,...\" emphasizes the point of the first sentence. The slower hardware of most older computers automatically translates to a reduced performance particularly when running new applications. Contrary to Answer B's \"As long as the computer works without errors, its actual performance will not degrade\", Answer A has pointed out that the lower specifications of older computers will eventually lead to reduced performance. These statements are true and factual because even if you have a perfectly fine 5-year old computer, it will not be able to run the latest operating systems or applications, because its hardware components are just incompatible with the requirements of new software. Answer A also mentioned about overheating issues caused by dust and debris \"...an older computer can accumulate dust and other debris...\" which is the same fact as the one stated in Answer B \"It is possible for parts to be damaged by heat...\".  \n\nAnswer A can be improved by including the aspect of software compatibility and how it can affect the overall performance of an older computer. For example: \"Older computers might not be able to perform smoothly in running new software applications due to limitations of hardware.\" Answer A can also include a statement like \"And although it is possible to replace a computer's CPU, memory, battery, hard drive and other components and installing new parts, it is a much better investment to simply buy a new one.\" ",

    "comments": "Answer A and Answer B both provided relevant and factual responses to the question. However, Answer A has given a simpler and easier to understand response compared to Answer B.\n\nI liked how Answer A started its explanation with a metaphorical comparison of a hard drive storage with that of a piece of paper \"Imagine a piece of paper...\". It was a simple yet effective comparison, illustrating how it is possible to write as many things on the paper but it has a limited space \"...You can write as many words on that paper...\". This paragraph on Answer A perfectly described the process of storing in a hard drive, which means that users can write as much as they want in a hard-drive until it eventually run out of space, just the same as writing on paper. Answer A has also responded to the second part of the question \"...Surely files aren't tangible, right?\" , although it was only implied by mentioning that data is saved as binary numbers 1's and 0's. (\"All data saved can be boiled down...\"). These are all factual information which indicates that data in itself is tangible through the series of 1s and 0s saved in the hard drives. \n\nAnswer A has minor grammatical mistakes such as missing words and misspellings. For example, in this sentence \"Eventually you will run of space\" should be \"Eventually you will run out of space.\" The word \"harddrive\" should also have a space in between, as well as correct the misspelling of \"Hardrives\". \n\nAnswer B also provided relevant and correct answer to the question. And it was actually difficult to choose between Answer A and Answer B because they have similar responses or statements. Compared with Answer A, Answer B went directly to the second part of the question \"Well, technically, they are tangible...\" Same as with Answer A, Answer B also mentioned \"a bunch of 0s and 1s\" as proof that hard drive storage is tangible. However, I felt that it was unnecessary to include about how this storage is composed of \"super-tiny switches\": \"...those 0s and 1s are basically stored is super-tiny switches...\". Although this information is accurate and correct, I don't think it is needed to answer the question (which I think only dealt with why hard drives run out of space.\" However, I do appreciate that Answer B has included that part about \"One Byte is 8 such switches...\" because it provides an illustration of the amount of storage that a hard drive can have. The statement that \"...but not infinite\" also reiterates that hard drive storage is a finite storage and that it will eventually run out of space.

    "comments": "Honestly, it is difficult to determine which of the two answers is more appropriate. Answer A is too simple and lacks detail. On the other hand, Answer B has provided an answer that looks complicated for someone who is just beginning to learn more about networking. In the end, I will be choosing Answer B because at least it added some hardware that is not mentioned in the question, compared with Answer A which just rephrase and repeated what is already indicated in the question. \n\nIn analyzing the question, it can be inferred that the question writer already has a basic idea of the hardware involved when communicating in the Internet. However, Internet communication is varied depending on the purpose, for instance, the hardware involved is different when you are just accessing Google to search for terms compared with the hardware involved when sending an email to someone across the world. So, it is difficult to list all the hardware that internet traffic passes through. \n\nAnswer A, essentially just repeated the question and mentioned the same hardware: \"router, switch and server...\" and \"optical equipment or a content delivery network\". There is little to no added value in the answer because we can assume that the one who wrote the question already knew about these pieces of hardware. However, the answer is not completely wrong. In its most basic and simplest form, indeed, the most common hardware that internet passes through are routers, switches and the web servers. Depending on what task the user is carrying out within the Internet and the companies involved, there might be other equipment involved such as optical equipment or a content delivery network. (Reference: https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm) Answer A provides factual information but not enough details to be valuable.\n\nAnswer B, on the other hand, provides more details about the hardware involved when using the Internet. It was nice that it goes direct-to-the-point of saying 'The short answer is a lot'. And compared to the vague response of Answer A, Answer B correctly stated that the amount of equipment involved varies depending on the destination \"...depends on where your destination server is...\". However, the part about '...how far away it is...\" is a bit confusing. Although the distance between the source and destination plays a part on the number of hardware involved, it is not solely dependent in the distance. Even if the location of the source and destination are closed together, it is possible for the destination to have other hardware for routing its Internet traffic. Again, this is on a case-to-case basis. \n\nHowever, the 'typical data path' stated in Answer B is the closest thing to a suitable answer to the question, although if the question writer is looking for a 'relatively simple answer' then Answer B might be a bit complicated. The path mentioned \"Laptop > Home Router > Modem > ISP CMTS...\" is factual and accurate, depending on several factors as stated earlier in Answer B's first sentences (...destination server is and how far away it is...). The inclusion of an NSA tracking device in between the ISP routers/servers feels unnecessary and does not really play a huge or vital part of communicating within the Internet. This is because there are probably more tracking mechanisms/firewalls in between the ISPs that no one exactly knows of outside of the ISPs. It is alright to include data centers on the list of hardware because most large companies use these facilities for their IT operations. It is also alright to include firewalls (\"Remote Companies Firewall>Remote Companies WAF\"), however, it should be stated that these are Hardware-based Firewall (because it is different from the typical firewall).The other hardware included are basically dependent on the company handling the destination server. For instance, \"Load balancers>Front end Servers>Database Servers\" are typically used by larger organizations that manage multiple servers, but not all web servers have these additional equipment. \n\nBasically, no one exactly knows the exact data path when accessing the Internet because it involves multiple companies such as the ISPs, network providers and destination company servers. However, there are articles that provide an overview of this network path such as in Google's handling of internet traffic. (Reference: https://www.wired.com/2015/06/google-reveals-secret-gear-connects-online-empire/). Answer B can be simplified by \"Your Laptop > Home Router > Modem > ISP servers> ISP Routers/Switches > Destination ISP Routers/Switches > CDN (if applicable) > Datacenter Routers and Switches > Hardware-based Firewall > Destination Servers (Front-end Servers and Database Servers). Again, this is not a complete list and only provides a general overview of the equipment involved in the Internet. For example, Content Delivery Network (CDN) mentioned in the question is not a required hardware, not all websites need to have a CDN, especially if the website does not expect access from multiple separate locations.

    "question_text": "How are cryptographic keys used to encrypt and decrypt data? In asymmetric encryption, we have a public and a private key. The way I understand it: The public key is a string that's known to everyone who communicates with someone who receives encrypted data and is used to convert data into cipher. The private key is another string that is only known to the receiver and *only that string* can be used to decrypt the data. How does that work if both strings are different?<br />Re symmetric encryption, again it's a mystery to me how a string is used to encrypt some other data but at least the key is the same and not a completely different sequence of characters.",
    "answer1": "It seems you have a decent working knowledge of encryption, but because this is eli5, consider this instead of the literal process.<br />In symmetric encryption, you have a lock box that can be locked or unlocked by only one key. That key is shared between two parties, and is responsible for both locking and unlocking.<br />In asymmetric encryption things get a bit spicier. The key metaphor breaks down, BUT you can imagine a public key to be a sealable box offered out to everyone. Once the box is sealed (with something inside) and it's sent back through the metaphorical mail, it can only be opened by the person who originally offered out the box because of manners and laws.<br />In reality the later can only occur due to math pioneered in the RSA algorithm which some folks even struggle with at 25. Just know that the products of large primes are involved, and tend to generate intermediate products in the hundreds of trillions.",
    "answer2": "So, first thing to realise is that Cryptography deals with numbers. You probably already know this, but this is ELI5 so I'll mention it to be sure.<br />So let's take a 2 digit number and multiply by 101, or 201, or 745301. Any number ending with 01. Then throw away all but the last 2 digits. You get what you start with.<br />We can split this number into factors. What 2 numbers can we multiply together to get 201? 67, and 3 work.  We can do this multiply and keep the last digits trick with each of these.<br />3 is our public key. 67 is our private key<br />So start with 61.    <br />Multiply by our public key to get 183.     <br />Keep the last 2 digits as our \"encrypted\" number - 83<br />To get and multiply by our private key of 67<br />83x67=5561.    <br />Take the last two digits and we have the number we started with.<br />So that illustrates the basic idea of asymmetric functions. But we can't use multiplication because it's too easy to reverse. We can do something similar with different mathematical operations though. Using powers of primes, in different numerical bases is one such operation. And there are formulas to generate  the numbers that will work for this.",

    "comments": "To better understand the different components of the question, we should break it apart into simpler questions. Basically, the question writer is asking about the process of how cryptographic keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data. Judging from the terms used in the question, we can assume that the writer already has an idea about asymmetric and symmetric encryption. In my opinion, the writer of the question only wants an explanation on what is the difference between the keys used in symmetric and asymmetric encryption and how they are used. \n\nI have chosen Answer A as the better response because it provides a clearer explanation about asymmetric and symmetric cryptography, compared to the confusing calculations of Answer B. \n\nJust from the get-go, I don't think that the writer of Answer B has understood the question clearly. And even if it mentions that it is aware that this is ELI5, the explanation is so technical and confusing, plus it does not even contribute to determining the difference between asymmetric and symmetric keys. To be fair, the calculations provided by Answer B are all correct and they do illustrate the basic idea of asymmetric functions. However, the problem is that Answer B did not even explain how the public and private keys of Answer B work in real-world. Worse, Answer B has completely forgotten about symmetric encryption and had never mentioned it.\n\nIn terms of explaining the concept behind symmetric and asymmetric encryption, Answer A is definitely better than Answer B. In its first sentence, Answer A has recognized the prior knowledge of the question writer \"...It seems you have a decent working knowledge of encryption...\". Answer A has also noted that this is ELI5 and so decided to explain the two types of encryption in the simplest way possible. \n\nCompared to Answer B, Answer A has a well-structured explanation that uses simple words and metaphors to convey meaning. This is good because it allows readers without prior knowledge about encryption to still recognize the difference between symmetric and asymmetric keys. \n\nAnswer A first explained about symmetric encryption in the paragraph \"In symmetric encryption, you have a lock box...\" In this part, we will notice that Answer A had used lock box (locks) and keys as metaphors for encryption. I think this is a good idea to illustrate encryption for beginners. The statements comparing symmetric encryption to a lock box with only one key is factual and accurate. It is true that symmetric encryption uses only one shared key for encryption and decryption of electronic data. (Reference: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/symmetric-cryptography)\n\nOn the second part of Answer A, it focuses more on explaining asymmetric encryption. The metaphor of a sealable box (as public key) was effective, although it was quite confusing as well. I particularly did not understand what Answer A means by \"...because of manners and laws.\" This part can be improved by just following the same structure as the explanation of symmetric encryption. It can be stated like \"In asymmetric encryption, it uses a pair of related keys - one public key and one private key, which are used to encrypt and decrypt a message.\" This can be followed by the explanation of what is the use of public and private key. \"The public key can be used by any person to encrypt a message, however, the intended receiver can only decrypt it using their private/secret key (which was shared by the key's initiator). For instance, if someone wishes to send a message that is encrypted, they can use the public key of the recipient from a public directory and use that key to encrypt the message before sending it. Using their corresponding private key, the message's recipient can then decrypt it. The processes of encryption and decryption happen automatically and the users do not need to physically lock and unlock the message.\" This explanation that I have written is just the same as the content of Answer A, but provided more explanation about the use of private and public keys. \n\nThe last paragraph of Answer A is a bit confusing as well. I am not sure what the last statements meant but the first sentence has a minor grammatical error in \"...in reality the later...\" which I think should be \"In reality the LATTER...\" However, even though it is confusing the last paragraph is quite meaningful because it is factual that the best example of asymmetric cryptography is the RSA algorithm. The last paragraph can be rewritten as \"One of the best examples of asymmetric encryption is the RSA encryption algorithm, which implements public/private keys in VPNs, ensuring a secure transmission of data and digital signatures.\"",

So by setting the computers up with these spells, programmers make it possible for non-programmers (muggles?) to use computers for things like posting such questions and getting responses on reddit, or searching for things online, or playing games, or watching cat videos.<br />Edit: should have also mentioned phones here, but I'm old school.",

    "comments": "Both Answer A and Answer B provided suitable responses to the question. However, even though Answer B seems casual and carefree with its metaphor example, I still preferred the direct and simple approach of Answer A. \n\nAnswer A responded to the question in a straight-forward manner. My issue with Answer A is in its first sentence: \"Programming is the instructions...\". In actuality, programming is the ACT of creating instructions for an electronic device; instructions are more often called as programs or codes instead. However, I appreciate that the definition given was simple and easy to understand.  The first sentence in itself already answered all the aspects of the question, by defining what programming is and then saying that it \"...make them do what we want them to...\". The examples given in this statement \"Your cell phone, computer, alarm clock,...\" also provides supporting hints on what programming or programs are. Answer A can be further improved by providing more examples in how programming (or programs, specifically) work in different devices such as phones and computers, as well as its impact in the future of the digital world. (Additional reference: https://codiska.com/articles/why-programming-is-important-today-and-for-the-future/) Answer A only has minor grammatical errors. The first statement of Answer A \"Programming is the instructions...\" should be rephrase as \"Programming involves the creation of instructions that...\" or something in that sense.\n\nJust based on length of the answer, Answer B seems to provide more information that Answer A.  And even though I quite like the use of metaphor such as comparing programs to \"recipes\" and \"spells\", in my opinion, the explanation felt more confusing that just using simple words. The introduction part of Answer B was actually great \"Computers are complicated machines...\" but the use of multiple metaphorical elements (...\"Programming is basically creating RECIPES...\" and \"...like combinations of magic spells...\") was too much. It would have been better to just use only one comparison, by choosing either a comparison with recipes or with spells. \n\nThe same confusion of metaphor continues in the  second paragraph of Answer B. The writer of the answer seems to shift back and forth between using the words \"recipes\" and \"spells\" and basically just repeated the same explanation present in the first paragraph. Although the statement \"...programmers make it possible for non-programmers...\" illustrated the value of programming for non-technical users, it does not really convey the real importance of programming in the world. The examples provided \"...playing games or watching cat videos\" were comedic but did not actually seriously answer the second part of the question. \n\nAnswer B can be further improved by toning down the metaphors and just choosing one comparison point (choose either recipes or spells and stick with it). The importance of programming should also be elaborated more by mentioning how it enables important electronic devices to function properly (compared with the mundane  example of playing games which isn't really significant). The writer of Answer B was also aware that the answer should have included other devices outside of computers, not just phones but also other common things such as cars, TVs, etc. \n\nIn summary, both Answer A and Answer B provided factual information about programming, but the directness and simplicity of Answer A makes it a better choice.

    "question_text": "how cloud storage is different than just storing my files on someone else's hard drive ",
    "answer1": "Well, it is just storing your files on someone else's hard drive. However the difference mainly comes in the fact most cloud storage solutions have way more infrastructure set up to make it as smooth as possible for you. They are always online, they can be accessed from anywhere, they probably have backups upon backups, they likely have better security than a random person with a hard drive, and so on and so forth. <br />Cloud services offer the service of your files being accessible from anywhere, at any time, without you having to worry about the details.",
    "answer2": "Cloud storage is a model of data storage in which the digital data is stored in logical pools, said to be on \"the cloud\". The physical storage spans multiple servers (sometimes in multiple locations), and the physical environment is typically owned and managed by a hosting company. These cloud storage providers are responsible for keeping the data safe and accessible, and the user is responsible for managing access to their data. <br /><br />Cloud storage is different than just storing files on someone else's hard drive in a few key ways. First, with cloud storage the user does not have direct control over the physical storage of their data. Second, cloud storage providers typically offer more robust security and protection against data loss than most individuals could provide on their own. Finally, cloud storage providers often offer additional features and services, such as versioning and access control, that can be difficult or impossible to replicate on one's own.",

    "comments": "It was difficult to determine which of the two answers is better because both Answer A and Answer B have provided factual and relevant explanation for the given question. However, I decided that Answer B has provided more details and is more well-structured compared to Answer A.\n\nTo be fair, Answer A provides a simple and easy-to-understand answer to the given question. All of its statements are factual and are based on real-world applications of cloud storage. It has responded well to the question by beginning its paragraph with '...it is just storing your files on someone else's hard drive.\" which directly addresses the question. Answer A has also provided a concise list of the difference of cloud storage solutions as compared with traditional storage (e.g. hard drive of another person) through the statements \"...they are always online,...\". And in its last statement, Answer A also gave a good summary and description of cloud services, although it was a bit confusing what it meant by \"worry about the details.\". There are minor grammatical errors in Answer A such as missing words (\"...comes in the fact most cloud storage solutions...\" which probably needs the word \"that\" in between \"fact\" and \"most\") and confusing phrases such as \"Cloud services offer the service of your files...\" which is better if \"service\" is replaced by \"storage\". \n\nAnswer B definitely is much more lengthy and detailed than Answer A. However, the main reason why I chose Answer B is because it seemed to be more well-structured than Answer A. Answer B started with a paragraph that provides a brief description of Cloud storage in which Answer B established that cloud storage when viewed physically is actually located in multiple servers across multiple locations. In the same paragraph, Answer B also mentioned that most cloud storage is owned by a hosting company which ensures its safety and accessibility. All these information are factual and accurate. However, in my opinion, it would have been better if Answer B also included several examples of popular cloud storage such as Google Drive, Dropbox, among others. \n\nIn the next paragraph of Answer B, it focuses mainly on the difference of cloud storage as compared with storing files on someone else's hard drive. This part addresses the main concern stated in the question, and the way Answer B listed the reasons in a more structured manner is the reason why I chose it over Answer A. All the points given such as control over the physical storage of data, more robust security and protection and additional features and services, are all valid and relevant. However, it would have been better to arrange the list into advantages and disadvantages of cloud storage. (Reference: https://www.promax.com/blog/10-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-cloud-storage). This is because the key differences listed by Answer B combined the positive with the negative. For instance, the first difference \"...the user does not have direct control over the physical storage of their data...\" is often perceived to be a negative side of cloud storage, particularly in the area of privacy. On the other hand, the second difference \"robust security and protection\" is a positive side of cloud storage, because it is true that cloud storage solutions have multiple backup and recovery options (as mentioned similarly in Answer A) in case of data loss. \n\nIn summary, both of the two answers are great in responding the questions and it was just a difference of structure and detail. Answer B can be improved by including examples of cloud storage and then summarizing briefly the advantage and disadvantage of cloud storage in comparison with storing your files on someone else's hard drive.

    "comments": "Although both Answer A and Answer B have provided adequate responses to the question, Answer A felt a little limited compared to the explanation provided by Answer B. However, it can be noted that these two answers can be combined together to provide two perspectives. The main difference between Answer A and Answer B is that Answer A supports the assumption of the question (server dictates the speed) while Answer B contradicts the assumption of the question (client dictates the speed). Both of these two perspectives can be right or wrong depending on various factors. \n\nIn analyzing the question, we can break it down into two aspects. First, the question writer is asking why high-speed internet matter. However, this first part presents an incorrect general assumption \"...if the speed of download and streaming is decided by how fast the server is...\" This is because even though there may be instances wherein the server has slow upload/download speed such as when it serves multiple users at one time, this is rarely the case. On the other hand, the second part of the question refers to the question writer's inquiry on \"what's the importance of getting like 1GBPs internet\" based on the writer's assumption that his internet speed doesn't matter because his Internet activities are dependent on the server's speed.\n\nI did not choose Answer A because it's scope is very limited to the subject of games. I have made this conclusion because Answer A have only mentioned \"steam\", \"game retailers\" and \"GTA V\". Although high-end PC games do require a high-speed internet, it was never mentioned in the question that this is the concern of the question writer. You will notice that the question only stated \"speed of download and streaming\" which is quite vague and broad. \n\nI like how Answer A went directly and called out the false assumption in the question by saying \"Because you got it wrong.\" The initial statements mentioned in Answer A are actually factual, particularly in online games. As Answer A said, \"Steam allows for really fast DNs...\", which is true for both Steam and other game retailers. Then, Answer A also stated that there was a previous instance that the ISP (probably on the server side) had a faster internet speed than normal (\"...One time there was some sort of mishap...\"). However, it should be noted that this sudden increases in internet speed on the server side rarely happens so it is not a solid basis to say that the speed of downloading and streaming is solely dictated by the server. It would have been better if Answer A have also included other types of Internet use such as video streaming and download rather than focus solely in games. Answer A had minor grammatical and context errors such as using the words \"battlestation\" and \"DNs\" which would be confusing to non-gamers or non-technical users. The concluding statement \"...I switched to faster plan as soon as I had the opportunity...\" also felt disconnected from the rest of the statements. It is quite confusing why the writer of Answer A suddenly decided to switch to a faster plan just because of a mishap from the ISP side of the server. It simply doesn't add up. \n \nI ultimately chose Answer B because it disproves the false assumptions in the question. Contrary to Answer A's example about a server side speed change, Answer B places the dependency on the client or user side. Answer B implied that the speed of downloading and streaming can be affected from the client side in the statement \"It's more about if you've got more people...\".To support his claim, Answer B provided an example \"...where I work we have 1gb leased line...\", wherein the 1GBPs connection have to be shared by multiple users. This is a realistic explanation that opens up more missing factors in the question. \n\nIn the example given by Answer B, it was mentioned that he/she is using a 'leased' line which is a dedicated line usually availed by companies and rarely by 'normal' users. Because it was never mentioned in the question on what type of line the question writer is using, it is difficult to assess on whether his internet speed is dependent solely on the server speed. If the question writer is using a shared broadband line, then it is highly possible that his internet speed is slower because the line he rented is shared by other users. (Reference: https://www.hso.co.uk/leased-lines/leased-line-broadband/21-differences-between-broadband-and-leased-line-connections). Answer B has also pointed out this factor in the statement \"It's more about supporting big internet hungry households...\". It is nice that Answer B have also mentioned about the possibility that sites/services may impose limits in the speed, but this is a situation that rarely happens and should be confirmed with the companies involved. \n\nAnswer B uses a conversational tone in its statements so the sentences  became lengthy. Some minor grammatical errors are punctuations such as in \"...intensive things - so...\" which can be written as \"...intensive things, so...\" as well as replacing the rest of  \"-\" with a full stop/period (.). There are parts that should be separated into two sentences such as \"...streaming etc where I work...\" which should be \"streaming, etc. Where I work...\" and \"...connecting to - it's more about...\" which should be \"...connecting to. It's more about...\"\n\nIn summary, both Answer A and B provided different perspectives in answering the question. Answer B can further be improved by mentioning the different factors that can affect the speed of download and streaming, preferably from both the server and client side. This can be included in a concluding paragraph that can be written as \"There are several factors that can affect the speed of download and streaming. From the client/user side, these factors include the number of users concurrently accessing the internet, client ISP downtime/server issues, type of internet connection line (shared broadband, leased/dedicated line), device used and many more. From the server side, factors might include server ISP issues, server-imposed limitations, number of users concurrently accessing the server, and many others.\" In this way, both perspectives will be covered.

Ok, so I recognize that it's sort of standard to say \"we don't really know how it works\" and I have read articles/internet comments (I don't remember which) saying that it \"resembles neurological patterns\"  in some capacity or form and that \"the way we don't understand how the brain works is the same way we don't understand how the human mind works\" \\[not exact quotes\\] with this sort of spooky implication that at some level it may represent either a very rudimentary form of consciousness or an important component/process/aspect of how consciousness has developed or formed, but beyond these kind of basic simplifications, is it actually coherent or factual to say these sorts of things or is this just wishful thinking that is attempting to personify a completely computational process?",

    "comments": "Honestly, it is difficult to choose between Answer A and Answer B. Both of their statements are factual and relevant, however, there is a difference in their level of complexity. Answer A provides a simpler and easy to understand explanation while Answer B focuses on a more in-depth take on neural networks. In the end, based on the context of the question, I will be choosing Answer A instead because it provides a direct response to the main aspect of the question. \n\nBefore comparing the two answers, it is necessary to analyze the question first. At first glance, the question seems to be complicated, however, upon analysis, I can summarize that the writer of the question only wants to know what is neural net, how it works and whether it represents a rudimentary form of consciousness or whether it is just an attempt to personify a completely computational process. As such, it is difficult to determine whether the writer of the question wants to know the technical aspects of neural networks or if the writer only wants the reassurance that neural networks does not have that 'spooky implication' that he/she assumes. Both Answer A and Answer B does not directly address the question writer's concern about this 'spooky implication' of neural networks. \n\nAnswer B provided a response that focuses on the more detailed technical aspect of neural networks. All the statements are factual and provide an accurate description of neural networks. It is true that \"neural network is made up of neurons.\" and that these 'neurons' perform functions that takes inputs, performs calculations and produces an output. I liked how Answer B explained this process in a simple and easy to understand way.\n\nHowever, the statements that followed are confusing, too complicated and too technical. Suddenly, after mentioning the simple flow of operations in the neurons within a neural network, Answer B continues with the arrangement of neurons into layers. This extensive explanation does not contribute much in answering the second aspect of the question, wherein the question writer is curious on the implications of neural networks in terms of consciousness, etc. The statements about the layers \"The first and last layers of the network are special...\" is unnecessary and only confuses the reader. The last paragraph of Answer B was actually more valuable because it refers to the \"magic of neural networks...\" in using known data to respond to unknown data. \n\nAnswer B has a great potential and can be improved by removing the complicated and unnecessary bits. It also has minor grammatical errors such as misspellings (\"...then spit out AND output.\" which should be \"AN output\"). The second sentence in the second paragraph is also too lengthy and confusing \"The neurons of the first layer...\".  \n\nCompared to Answer B, Answer A provides a much simpler and shorter response to the question. The tone of the statements of Answer A is also more casual and less technical compared to Answer B.\n\nThe first sentences of Answer A simply described a neural net as a computer program \"A neural net is really just a computer program...\". This statement is factual and realistic because no matter its complexity, in the end, neural networks are just a form of computer programming, in the same context as artificial intelligence and machine learning. The second part of the first sentence also perfectly responds to the question \"...is designed to simulate the workings of the brain.\". If we will go back to the question, the writer of the question actually mentioned the same words that neural networks \"resembles neurological patterns\". Indeed, the inner workings of neural networks aims to resemble how the brain works, although not exactly. \n\nAnswer A also provides a simple, basic explanation of how neural networks work in this statement \"How it works is that it takes in input data...\" However simple it may sound, it is actually the same flow in most processes done by computers. All processes done by computers, no matter how complex or simple it may be, follow the same flow of input - \nprocess - output. Answer A also included a statement \"The processing that it does is based on a set of rules...\" which emphasizes the difference of neural networks with other computer processes. What sets neural networks apart from other computing technologies is that it can 'remember' or 'learn' sets of rules or patterns from known data or 'previous experience' and then use the same rules in dealing with unknown data or situations. This is why neural networks is a term usually used alongside concepts such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. \n\nOne thing that is missing from Answer A is that it did not address the second aspect of the question wherein the question writer is asking whether a neural net has its own rudimentary consciousness or whether it is just a representation of a computational process. This can be answered by \"Although neural networks aims to simulate how the human mind works, it cannot fully resemble all neurological patterns because it is limited by its own programmed algorithms, rules and patterns. Even though neural networks or artificial intelligence for that matter can 'learn' from 'experience', in the end, it is only a representation of a computational process.\" or a statement similar to this one. Answer A can also be further improved by adding examples of the application of neural networks (or its main field: artificial intelligence) such as with common functions like text prediction (smartphone keyboards), voice commands (like Siri), and even AI chatbots (which can simulate human-like conversations). \n",

Both of the answers did not point out this assumption, however, I understand why it is dismissed because it is not directly related to graphics compatibility. \n\nI actually liked how Answer A enumerated the ways on how it is possible for modern video cards to render graphics in old games. The description of an emulator is spot-on and factual \"...using an emulator, which is a software program that imitates the hardware of an older system...\". Emulators do indeed allow users to run older systems (or even completely different operating systems) but there are games that might be rendered poorly. For example, using an emulator to play a graphics-intensive game will most probably have image rendering problems. However,  I do not recommended the second way \"...Another way is by using a graphics processor that is specifically designed to render graphics in old games...\" unless the user is an avid gamer who really needs to render old games. From a technical perspective, it makes no sense to use an older graphics processor. This is because older graphics processor might not even be compatible with modern motherboards or won't even be the required graphics to run a modern operating system. If you will check the system requirements of modern operating systems like Windows 11, you can see that it has a minimum requirement (DirectX 12 or later) which means that using an older graphics processor won't even allow you to install the latest operating system. (Reference: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications?r=1)\n\nI like how Answer B uses simple words to explain how modern video cards are able to render older games. It correctly responds to the question by pointing out that the core/basic standard of rendering video games has been the same for many years, even with changes to hardware and operating system. (\"...the basic communication standard for video games...\"). This is factual information that directly responds to the question. Similar with Answer A, Answer B also mentions the use of emulators and virtual machines as well as game distribution platforms like GOG (Good Old Games), which are all possible ways to run old games in modern operating systems (\"...Even far older games from the MS DOS area...\"). The last statement of Answer B which uses a metaphor to compare old games with an old car \"...Imagine having an old car from the 1920...\" is also surprisingly effective (albeit in an informal way) in illustrating the possibility of running old games on a new highway (operating system/graphics processor). The game might not look perfect but it will certainly run on modern graphics cards/OS. One thing that I might suggest is to remove the 'SYL' part in Answer B. ",

    "comments": "Before analyzing each of the two answers, I would like to focus first on the question. One issue with the question (which is also pointed out by Answer B) is that the question writer is asking \"...how do people install software/programs on pcb boards...\". This is confusing and vague because PCB boards aren't really programmable. Initially, I actually thought that the question writer is referring to 'PCB Design' which is the process of designing the layout of the electrical connections of the PCB, however, by the mention of 'install software/programs...', it became clear that the question sounds incorrect. To better understand this confusing part of the question, we should first define what is a PCB or printed circuit board. (Reference: https://www.power-and-beyond.com/whats-a-printed-circuit-board-pcb-a-893758/). Based on definitions from various references (and my own experience), PCBs are \"used to mechanically support and electrically connect electronic components.\" From this definition, it is easy to conclude that it is not a component where you can install software/programs. That is why, the first and second part of the question is already incorrect from the start.\n\nCompared to Answer B, Answer A attempted to respond to the question by citing the process when programming microcontrollers. The process mentioned in Answer A is actually correct and factual \"...write the software on a PC and then it gets downloaded onto the microcontroller...\". However, it is not relevant to the incorrect question and will only confuse the reader even more. Programming a microcontroller is different from 'programming' a PCB. When someone writes programs for microcontrollers (such as Arduino), they are actually programming its chip not the PCB. In fact, microcontroller programming is synonymous to microchip programming. (Reference: https://sciencing.com/learn-microprocessor-programming-7483604.html)\n\nThe main reason why I chose Answer B over Answer A is because Answer B was able to point out the incorrect assumption in the question. The statements \"You don't install software on PCBs...\" perfectly addresses the false assumption. This part of Answer B can further be improved by including the definition of PCB that I mentioned on an earlier paragraph. (Reference: https://www.power-and-beyond.com/whats-a-printed-circuit-board-pcb-a-893758/). This can be added as \"PCBs or Printed Circuit Boards are simply boards that mechanically support and electrically connect electronic components through etched conductive pathways/tracks.\" This will be enough to provide the question writer and reader an idea about what a PCB really is, and that it is different from a microchip. \n\nThe succeeding statements starting from \"Some chips are just not programmable...\" focus more on chip programming and should be on a separate paragraph altogether. This part of Answer B is similar to the one mentioned in Answer A, which is programming a microcontroller. The details stated in Answer B are all correct and factual, however, the structure of the explanation should be improved. The statements can be summarized as \"Software/programs can be installed or programmed into chips and microcontrollers. There are chips that can be programmable and there are some that already have a 'program' physically baked into the chip. When dealing with chip or microcontroller programming, you will usually write the software on a PC using a specific language like C programming language. This program is then downloaded into the microcontroller over USB or with a custom programmer, and then executed on the microcontroller. \" If you will notice, I have combined the statements from Answer A and Answer B to come up with a better answer that corrects the question and then provides an introduction to microchip programming.

    "answer1": "There are a few reasons why CMOS batteries are used on motherboards instead of just having a small flash storage. <br /><br />One reason is that the CMOS battery can provide a constant power supply to the motherboard, even when the computer is turned off. This is important because the CMOS battery stores important information about the computer's settings, such as the date and time. If the CMOS battery runs out of power, these settings will be reset and the computer will not be able to function properly. <br /><br />Another reason is that CMOS batteries are not as susceptible to data loss as flash storage. This is because CMOS batteries retain their data even when the power is off, whereas flash storage needs power in order to keep its data intact. This means that CMOS batteries are more reliable for storing important data. <br /><br />Overall, CMOS batteries are more efficient and reliable than flash storage for storing data on motherboards.",

    "comments": "Prior to analyzing the two answers, I would first like to point out something confusing with the question itself. By breaking down the question, we can infer that it is asking why CMOS batteries are needed in motherboards instead of using a small flash storage. What is incorrect about this question is that CMOS batteries is not a storage device like flash memory/storage. The use of CMOS batteries is to provide power to the CMOS chip when the computer is turned off. The CMOS chip is the one that stores data, not the CMOS battery. That is why, it makes no sense to compare CMOS batteries with flash storage. It would have been better if it was a comparison between flash memory and the CMOS chip, because both of them has the purpose of storing data. \n\nThe two answers are quite similar with each other. Answer A provides a lengthy explanation of CMOS batteries but there is a huge confusion between battery and chip. On the other hand, Answer B provides a simple explanation but lacks details that clarifies why CMOS batteries are still used in PCs and laptops. Because of this, I have to choose on which of the two has more potential for improvement, which would be Answer B.\n\nTo be fair, Answer A actually provided some relevant and factual information but the confusion between CMOS battery and CMOS chip is so glaring that it was difficult to ignore. This is the main reason why I did not choose it as the better answer. Answer A is also very well-structured and had no grammatical errors. Its only problem is the confusion in its content. \n\nThe confusion between CMOS battery and CMOS chip is evident starting from the first reason cited in Answer A. The first statement referring to the function of CMOS battery in providing \"...a constant power supply to the motherboard,  even the computer is turned off.\" is completely wrong. The CMOS battery DOES NOT power the motherboard, it powers the CMOS chip. The second statement makes it worse \"...the CMOS battery stores important information about the computer's settings...\". This is an incorrect statement. The CMOS battery is just a battery. The one that stores the computer's settings, such as the date and time, is the CMOS chip. The third statement does not help either. \"If the CMOS battery runs out of power...the computer will not be able to function properly.\" This is not true. A computer (whether a PC or laptop) will still function properly even without a CMOS chip. However, there will be minor issues such as the BIOS settings will be reset/cannot be saved and that time and date will be inaccurate. (Reference:https://10scopes.com/will-motherboard-boot-without-cmos-battery/#:~:text=Yes%2C%20absolutely.,unable%20to%20save%20BIOS%20settings.) \n\nThe second part of Answer A confirms my suspicion that Answer A is confused between CMOS batteries and CMOS chip. This is obvious in the second sentence \"...This is because CMOS batteries retain their data even when the power is off...\" This is incorrect again. The CMOS batteries does not contain any data, it is the CMOS chip that retains data. And it is the CMOS battery that powers the CMOS chip so that it will retain that data. The description of flash storage as \"...needs power in order to keep its data intact.\" is also wrong, because flash memory can retain a small amount of charge to keep its content intact. \n\nAnswer B has a considerably shorter explanation compared to Answer A. Even if I mentioned earlier that the two answers are similarly bad, Answer B does contain factual and relevant information. Its first sentence \"Using true nonvolatile storage is possible...\" is surprisingly true, especially in modern laptops. According to several articles online (Reference:https://whatsabyte.com/do-all-laptops-have-a-cmos-battery/), most modern laptops already store CMOS settings in flash memory (\"true nonvolatile storage\") instead of in the CMOS chip present in older models.  However, PC motherboards (and other laptop motherboards) still do use CMOS chips (and an accompanying CMOS battery) for storing settings. \n\nThe second part of Answer B mentions about a clock that the battery is used for. \"...the battery is used to still run the clock...\". Although not explained properly in Answer B, it is true that in modern laptops, the traditional CMOS battery has functioned more as an RTC battery, keeping track of the computer's real-time clock when it is unplugged from the power source. (Reference:https://whatsabyte.com/do-all-laptops-have-a-cmos-battery/)\n\nThe last statement of Answer B \"Not everyone has their machine connected...\" is not relevant to the question and must therefore be removed. \n\nAnswer B can be improved by adapting the structure of Answer A. We can also include some statements from Answer A (the corrected version replacing CMOS batteries with CMOS chips). Answer B can be rewritten as: \"CMOS batteries on motherboards of PCs and laptops are still needed because CMOS chips are still used to store BIOS settings and date and time. Nowadays, some modern laptops have replaced the traditional CMOS chip with non-volatile flash memory for storing the BIOS settings. However, the CMOS batteries still exist and are often called as RTC batteries because their main function has changed into providing power to the computer's real-time clock (for updated date and time) when the computer is turned off or unplugged from a power source. \n",

    "comments": "Both answers has provided a suitable response to the question, however, I will choose Answer A as the better answer because it has clearly explained the reason why save game files are smaller than the actual game. \n\nAlthough I appreciate the metaphor used in Answer B to address the question, in my opinion, it was ineffective and will only confuse the reader. Save game files (game saves) are indeed comparable to pieces of a map (\"...Imagine a map of the world...\") and it is true that saving a game follows the same concept (\"...I don't need an entire copy of the map...\"). However, this type of metaphor might confuse the reader into thinking that game saves only include map locations of the character. Take note that the word 'map' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_(video_games)#:~:text=In%20video%20games%2C%20a%20level,players%20with%20different%20skill%20levels.) is a common term in games so it is easy to misinterpret it within the context of gaming. Answer B's statement \"I don't need a copy of a complex render of a sword...\" overcomplicates the answer even more by using words such as 'render' and 'animation', both of which are relevant terms to gaming (games usually save copies of character sprites (image files of characters) in the device for quick rendering) and might be misinterpreted.\n\nI chose Answer A as the better answer because it provides a clear response to the question. It has provided a definition of the word 'game save' using simple words \"...It's just a list of the stuff the game needs to remember about your character...\". The way Answer A has described game saves is factual and correct. (Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saved_game) It is correct that a game save or save file is not a copy of the game, instead it contains information about the player and his/her progress in the game, including inventory, location, etc. The example provided by Answer B '...It doesn't need another copy of the physics engine...\" also supports the explanation and makes it easier to understand. \n\nHowever, Answer A can be improved by stating that \"The contents of save game files vary depending on the game.\" The answer can also include a brief statement that mentions \"There are different types of save game files and although they are relatively smaller in file size compared to the game itself, they do differ in size depending on content.\"",

First, it failed to define what is a game engine as well as the differences between game engines. The statements \"...You can also build your own engine...\" and \"Some of them are open source...\" are irrelevant to the question. To be fair, both of these statements are factual and it is indeed possible to use your own game engine for small game projects although it is not recommended for commercialized games. (Reference:https://cgobsession.com/should-you-make-your-own-game-engine/). Answer B also has some minor grammatical mistakes such as pronoun confusion \"...Some of them are open source so THEY can take a copy...\". \n\nContrary to Answer B, Answer A has a well-structured and clear response to the question. First, it has described a game engine in the simplest words \"...a game engine is a tool used to create a video game...\" and even compared it to an artist's studio \"If you walk into the studio of a sculpter...\". These statements about a game engine are all factual and were stated in an easy-to-understand choice of words. (Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine). The succeeding statement of Answer A also partially responds to the second part of the question referring to the suitability of game engines to certain games: \"...Thus game engines are usually designed for types of games...\".  However, this part of the answer is a bit incomplete and does not clearly provide an answer as to why some game engines are more suitable for certain types of games.\n\nAnswer A also has a minor grammatical errors such as misspellings (...If you walk into the studio of a SCULPTER...\". The sentence \"Thus game engines are usually designed for types of games...\" is a bit confusing and can be modified as \"Game engines are usually designed for SPECIFIC types of games.

For example, Answer A can enumerate the most popular game engines at the moment such as Unity, Unreal, Open3D, etc. (https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/most-popular-game-engines).

    "question_text": "Why before 2012 I was told to use two sticks of RAM for gaming and now people are advising me to buy four in order to get maximum performance? ",
    "answer1": "Dual and quad channel.<br />Dual channel means the CPU and motherboard can use two sticks at once, doubling the performance. This means the performance of the memory, mind you, not of the entire system.<br />In modern times you have quad channel which is the same sort of thing -- the board and CPU can talk to all 4 RAM sticks at once.<br />Which means that a configuration of say, one 32 GB stick will be slower than 8+8+8+8.<br />In practice though the performance difference isn't as huge as it sounds, because from the point of view of a CPU, RAM is very slow, and the CPU uses its own internal cache whenever it can. This means the speed of RAM only matters when the CPU doesn't have what it needs on hand. This means that 4X faster memory might actually translate to a 10-20% real performance difference.<br />Still, if your board has support for it, lower size RAM sticks are cheaper, and you don't see the need to add more in the future, there's really no reason not to do it. A small performance benefit is better than none in any case.<br />If you look for benchmarks you may find some very confusing results -- some games don't care about dual/quad channel at all, some have huge performance differences. That's because different games use memory differently. A small, lightweight game probably won't benefit much. A game that pushes the limits and uses lots of RAM will probably benefit quite noticeably though.",
    "answer2": "The reason people are advising you to buy four sticks of RAM instead of two is because of the way RAM is distributed across the different channels on your motherboard. Most motherboards have four RAM slots, which are divided into two channels. If you have two sticks of RAM, they will be placed in the two slots on one of the channels. This can lead to a performance bottleneck, because the CPU can only access one stick of RAM at a time on that channel. However, if you have four sticks of RAM, they can be placed in the slots on both channels, which will allow the CPU to access two sticks of RAM at the same time and thus increase your gaming performance.",

That is why, I am choosing Answer A as the better answer. \n\nBefore comparing the two answers, it can be inferred that the premise of the question is actually a partial assumption, after all, it stated that some 'people are advising me to buy four in order to get maximum performance'. This means that the writer of the question already has an assumption or perception that four sticks of RAM might result to a maximum performance in gaming, which truthfully is not always the case. \n\nCompared to Answer A, Answer B has provided a much direct and simpler response to the question. All the statements included in Answer B are factual and accurate. It is true that the main reason why people are advising to buy four sticks of RAM is because of the channels \"The reason people are advising you...\" The supporting statements were also correct, because it is valid that the CPU can only access one stick of RAM per channel, even if you have installed two sticks on the two slots. However, the last statement which includes \"...thus increase your gaming performance\" can be considered an assumption. Even if you choose the 4-stick configuration, there is no guaranteed increase in the gaming performance and it still depends on other factors as well as the game involved. (Reference:https://www.techspot.com/article/1971-more-ram-modules-better-for-gaming/)\n\nAnswer A immediately stated the reason for the 2-stick or 4-stick RAM configuration, which is 'Dual and quad channel'. The definition of Dual and Quad channel were also clear and simple, using words that can easily be understood even by non-technical users. The explanation is factual and correct and in my opinion, was explained really well. It was easy to understand that dual means accessing two RAM sticks at once while quad means accessing 4 sticks at once. \n\nThe statements of Answer A are very well-structured and follows a single flow of thought. After explaining the difference between dual and quad channels, the following sentences emphasized that the jump in performance in using 4 sticks isn't really that huge, and it still depends on computer usage and user preference as stated on \"Still, if your board has support for it...A small performance benefit is better than none in any case.\" It is a realistic response to the question, and informs the user that using a 4-sticks of RAM does not automatically translate to better performance (in contrary to the advise given to the question writer by other people). \n\nThe succeeding statements of Answer A deal with the main part of the question referring to what is the difference between using two sticks of RAM and 4 sticks of RAM in reference to gaming. It was good of Answer A to point out that the result of benchmarks for gaming performance can vary. This is factual and realistic. There is no exact answer whether using a 4-stick configuration will increase the gaming performance for all games. As stated in the last paragraph of Answer A \"...because different games use memory differently.\" This is a valid statement because the question writer did not specifically mentioned what game he/she is playing and why he needs the performance boost. It can be inferred that in some games there won't be much of a difference, but in other games, there might be noticeable improvement. \n\nIn summary, both Answer A and B are correct, as they both responded to the question with valid statements, specifically the difference between dual and quad channels, as well as the comparison of 2-stick and 4-stick RAM configuration.

All the reasons stated in Answer A are factual and supported by references about chess computers (Reference: https://softwarechess.com/can-chess-computers-beat-humans/). It is great that Answer A has gone beyond the obvious advantage of the computing power of chess computers and also included the perspective of a human's susceptibility to mistakes due to various factors (\"...chess computers are not susceptible to making the kinds of mistakes...) Answer A's concluding statement that \"...chess computers can store vast amounts...\" is also factual and recognizes the continuous evolution and improvement of chess computers and computers in general, especially in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

    "question_text": "What is happening inside the computer when it \"bricks\"? So I heard the term 'bricked' when people were complaining about Fallout 76 bugs. What is happening inside the computer that a video game makes the computer not turn on?",
    "answer1": "Usually, an important ROM (Read Only Memory) that contains important data (For example the most basic information on how to turn on, how to decode input from the keyboard, etc) is damaged. So when you start the computer (PC or a PSP or something else), it does not know what to do next!<br />Technically, companies are able to fix a bricked device but they usually don't. I remember Sony would replace your PSP and gave you a new one with a relatively small fee.<br />I don't know if a game would brick a PC though. Usually, it happens when you are upgrading the firmware/BIOS. Games don't have access to that.",
    "answer2": "So \"bricked\" when used with the Fallout 76 stuff is a bit of a misnomer. \"bricking\" electronics means damaging an internal component or software in such a way that you can NEVER recover from it. <br />Wiping core system ROMS, heating system beyond normal and destroying components, wiping BIOS are all forms of \"bricking\" ( you computer is as good as a \"brick\" now, doesn't and won't do anything)<br />The fallout 76 game was terribly optimized and was overheating people poorly built, or poorly cooled systems. To be fair to Fallout, if their system was that poorly designed, a failure was inevitable. People also reported it breaking their OS and windows would not boot anymore, but that is not \"bricking\" in the traditional sense. What you heard from the media was hype over a hated game. Games very very very rarely cause these types of issues, mainly because they don't have the ability to cause said \"bricking\"",

    "comments": "Both Answer A and B responds correctly to the question. Although Answer A provides a brief explanation about what happens when a computer \"bricks\", it does not respond directly to the second part of the question which refers to Fallout 76. On the other hand, Answer B addresses all the aspects of the question by explaining about bricking as well as the misconception about video games causing computers or other devices to brick. \n\nAnswer A does not have any fatal grammatical mistakes, however, it does contain assumptions such as in the statements \"Technically, companies are able to fix a bricked device but they usually don't. I remember Sony would replace your PSP and gave you a new one with a relatively small fee...\". Replacing bricked devices is subject to the terms and conditions of manufacturers, and most of them would first investigate first what caused the bricking (such as whether the user caused it or there is a hardware malfunction in the device). One thing that I liked about Answer A is how it responded to the question using simple conversational words that can be easily understood by anyone. \n\nAnswer B has responded to the question in a clear and easy to follow manner. It is great that it has first described what is \"bricking\" and how it is connected to the game Fallout 76. The statements provided by Answer B are all factual. The definition of bricking \"...\"bricking\" electronics means damaging an internal component or software in such a way that you can NEVER recover from it.\" is correct. (Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_(electronics)#:~:text=A%20%22brick%22%20(or%20%22,brick's%20modern%20technological%20usefulness.) The examples given such as \"...Wiping core system ROMS, heating system beyond normal and destroying components, wiping BIOS are all forms of \"bricking\"...) are all relevant and factual. \n\nAlthough I haven't played Fallout 76, by consulting forums about the game and issues regarding it, I agree about Answer B's opinion that it was just an overhyped issue about the game (\"...What you heard from the media was hype over a hated game...\"). Plus I cannot even find a statement from the game's developer/publisher Bethesda that directly addresses game issues or bugs. The misconception that games can brick devices are primarily discussed in forums and there is no clear answer to this question as it is a case to case basis. It is indeed possible for terribly optimized games (\"...The Fallout 76 game was terribly optimized...) to cause issues in PCs, consoles and mobile devices, but there are many factors that can affect this such as hardware conditions (old and slow devices won't be able to handle higher-end games especially heating issues), software or system incompatibilities, etc.  Answer B's statement that \"The fallout 76 game was terribly optimized...\" can be considered an assumption because as I have mentioned earlier, it depends on the device and the system. It is possible for a game to be optimized to work properly in one system and fail on another system. That is why, games have recommended settings for it to work well. This part \"...The Fallout 76 game was terribly optimized...\" can be rephrased as \"Some players have complained that Fallout 76 was terribly optimized. However, overheating issues mostly occur on poorly built or poorly cooled systems, and these issues can also be influenced by many other factors outside of the video game.\"\n\nAnswer B's statement that \"People also reported it breaking their OS and windows would not boot anymore, but that is not \"bricking\" in the traditional sense.\" is factual. By checking the definition of firmware (https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-firmware-2625881), games do not typically access this part of a device and does not usually cause changes to a device's core software. \n\nAnswer B has minor grammatical mistakes such as capitalization of first letters in sentences or phrases (\"...\"bricking\" electronics means damaging an internal...\" and \"...and windows would not boot anymore\") as well as misspellings such as \"...you computer is as good as a \"brick\" now..\" which should be \"...your computer...\" and missing apostrophes \"...overheating people poorly built, or poorly cooled systems...\" which should be \"overheating people's poorly built...\"\n\nIn summary, both Answer A and B have provided correct responses to the question, however, Answer B has given a more detailed answer that addresses all the components of the question, especially with the context regarding Fallout 76.

    "answer1": "When you save something to an SD card or flash drive, the device writes the data to a memory chip. This chip is made up of thousands of tiny cells that can each hold a charge. When you remove the SD card or flash drive from your computer, the chip continues to hold the stored data. Even if there is no power source, the data will remain stored on the chip until it is erased.",
    "answer2": "You might be familiar with transistors. They are basically tiny switches. One kind of transistor called Field Effect Transistor (FET) conducts electricity if you apply a voltage to its gate. If you remove the voltage it doesn’t conduct (or vice-versa, there are two flavours).<br />https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/rel-assets/dsauto/temp/uploaded/What_is_mosfet.png?w=1042<br />The nice thing about FETs is that almost no current flows through the gate. <br />Flash memory is millions of special FETs with “floating” gates.<br />The gate has a tiny capacitance which means it can hold a tiny bit of charge. Since almost no current flows through the gate this charge can last for years once it has been charged.<br />You can use this to store data. Reading doesn’t require you to remove the charge, you simply check if the transistor is conducting or isn’t.",

    "comments": "Both Answer A and Answer B are similarly good. However, the two answers are different in terms of technical complexity. Because of this, I decided to choose Answer A in the basis that it has a much simpler explanation compared to Answer B. \n\nEven though I have not chosen Answer B as the better answer, Answer B is actually factual and relevant. The main focus of Answer B's explanation is on the concept of transistors \"...You might be familiar with transistors...\". My only issue with Answer B is how it is constructed. The introduction to transistors was so sudden that the reader will get confused on how it is related to the question. It would have been better if Answer B started with the sentence \"Flash memory is millions of special FETs with \"floating\" gates.\" and then following it up with the definition of an FET. This way, the flow of thought is much easier to follow, and the reader will not get confused with the relevance to the question. \n\nThe description of FETs in Answer B is on-point and accurate. (Reference: https://stonefly.com/resources/what-is-flash-memory-all-about) It is true that flash memory is composed of FETs (floating gates) and that its main characteristic is that it can hold charge and store data. The explanations given \"..The gate has a tiny capacitance which means...\" are also correct and based on the actual way of how flash memory works. The only problem with Answer B is that these explanations were not organized properly and it ended up being a jumbled mess of repetitive statements. You will notice this repetition on multiple sentences such as with the phrase \"...no current flows through the gate\" which is repeated twice in Answer B, as well as similar phrases such as \"...remove the voltage it doesn't conduct...\" in the top paragraph and repeated on the last paragraph as \"...check if the transistor is conducting or isn't.\". The information is correct, but it is just so confusing. \n\nAnswer A, on the other hand, is so much simpler and does not use highly technical words that might be unfamiliar with a non-technical reader. Compared with Answer B which immediately goes off about transistors, Answer A provided an explanation that is easier to understand and yet still direct to the point in answering the question. The statements mentioned in Answer A are also factual and accurate, as well as stated in a much clearer manner than that of Answer B. The process flow of storing data in a memory chip was described properly starting with the sentence \"When you save something to an SD card...\" This process flow is correct and explains the process in simple words. The statement \"This chip is made up of thousands of tiny cells...\" is actually referring to the FETs mentioned in Answer B. \n\nAnswer A is so well-structured that it opens up lots of potential for improvement. It is possible to improve Answer A by combining it with some of the technicality in Answer B. Answer A can be rephrased in the following manner. After the sentence \"This chip is made up of thousands...\", we can insert the information about transistors included in Answer B such as \"These array of cells is made up of transistors called Field Effect Transistor (FET) with floating gates, allowing it to hold a tiny bit of charge and store data.\" And then this sentence can be followed up with the rest of the explanation from Answer A \"...When you remove the SD card...\"",

    "answer1": "Not sure why everyone here is saying it's super expensive to restore deleted files. <br />Free ware programs can often recover files over written by 0.",
    "answer2": "When the hard drive is writing it's basically turning a sequence of electric pulses into magnetic fields being one direction or another.<br />If I overwrite a 1 with a 0, it's going to trying to turn the magnetic domain on that area of the platter 180 degrees. Because it's only a pulse, the magnetic field may only turn 175 degrees or 170 degrees. It's still clearly the other direction but not quite aligned. If I overwrite a 0 with a 0 it's going to reinforce the direction of the magnetic domain because the pulse is going to drag whatever crystals are almost in line even further in line with the magnetic field lines.<br />Now say I run over that disk but instead of looking for north-south alignment I look for magnetic domains that are close to perfectly aligned and magnetic domains that are out of alignment. If the magnetic domain is out of alignment I know it's probably going to be a 1 overwritten by a 0. If it's strongly aligned I know it's probably a 0 that was reinforced by being written to by another 0.",

    "comments": "It is difficult to determine which of the two answers is correct because both the two answers are quite incorrect. Upon analysis, the question asks whether it is possible to recover the data if a hard drive is wiped with all zeros. Although Answer B contains explanation about how a hard drive is written, it does not clearly answer the question. Therefore, I am choosing Answer A because it at least provides a definite answer to the 'how' part of the question. \n\nThe question does not contain any false assumptions. However, unfortunately, both Answer A and B does not provide a direct response to the given question. \n\nAt first glance, Answer B seems to provide a detailed explanation (\"If I overwrite a 1 with a 0, it's going...\"), however, the information provided does not even respond to the question. The facts mentioned about how hard drive is written (\"When the hard drive is writing it's basically turning a sequence of electric pulses into magnetic fields being one direction or another...\") is correct but the succeeding statements overcomplicate things without addressing the actual question, making them irrelevant. Answer A, on the other hand, responds to the question partially by mentioning about freeware recovery programs (\"Free ware programs can often recover files over written by 0...\").\n\nDue to its over-explained paragraphs, although Answer B does not have fatal grammar mistakes, the construction of the sentences makes it very confusing and complicated both for technical and non-technical readers. The sentences seem to not flow in a single thought and it seemed that the writer is only repeating the same things over and over. (\"If I overwrite a 1 with a 0....\", \" If I overwrite a 0 with a 0...\")\n\nAnswer B provides factual, albeit confusing information about how a hard drive writes data using binary numbers (0 and 1) \"When the hard drive is writing it's basically turning a sequence of electric pulses into magnetic fields being one direction or another...\" (Reference: https://cs.stanford.edu/people/nick/how-hard-drive-works/#:~:text=The%20hard%20drive%20contains%20a,the%20stored%200's%20and%201's). It also provides an explanation of how wiping a hard drive means overwriting the existing bits with random values or with zeros. \n\nAlthough Answer A provides a hint of a direct answer to the question, unfortunately, it is based on a false assumption. First, the statements \"Not sure why everyone here is saying it's super expensive to restore deleted files.\" and \"Free ware programs can often recover files over written by 0.\"  are assumptions not based on real-world applications. To explain it, the question actually refers to zero filling, a method of wiping a hard drive with all zeros, usually in multiple passes. (Reference: https://www.techopedia.com/definition/10143/zero-filling#:~:text=Zero%20filling%20is%20a%20method,undone%20from%20the%20hard%20drive.). Consulting various references and tech forums, the statement given by the writer of Answer A contradicts what is known by most experts. Zero filling is one of the most effective way to wipe the data written on a hard drive. Without expensive hardware and expert personnel, it is difficult to recover any data within that wiped hard drive. (https://askubuntu.com/questions/21501/possibility-of-recovering-files-from-a-dd-zero-filled-hard-disk). However, it is indeed possible for some freeware programs to recover SOME parts/bits of files over written by 0 but it is near impossible to recover whole usable files (unless you have specialized equipment). \n\nBoth answers are actually incorrect. Answer B strays too far from the question and does not respond to it while Answer A provides false assumptions and generalizations without basis. \n\nIn this regard, Answer A can be improved by giving more information about what zero filling is and reversing the statements. Instead of saying that 'freeware programs can recover files...', it should be made clear that it is not always the case and the likelihood (whether in reality or theoretically) of file recovery is difficult unless using powerful computers and expert data recovery specialists. \n\nAn improved Answer A can be stated as \"Wiping a hard drive with all zeros, often referred to as zero filling, is one of the most effective way to wipe the data written on a hard drive. To answer the question, it is theoretically possible to recover the data within the wiped hard drive, given the appropriate hardware, software and personnel. Some freeware programs claim to recover files from a zero-filled hard drive, but aside from bits and pieces of the files, it is near impossible to recover whole usable files.\"",
