    "question_text": "If under anesthesia do you get your sleep needed for the day?<br />",
    "answer1": "No. The unconsciousness induced by both IV anesthetics and inhaled anesthetics is very different from restorative sleep. In fact, patients in ICUs who are sedated for long periods of time with some of the same medications they use in anesthesia get delirium from both a lack of sleep and a lack of proper awake time. <br />This is also true for prescription benzodiazepines like Ativan (lorazepam) and Xanax (alprazolam) which are often prescribed for insomnia but do not produce true sleep. <br />There is an IV sedative called Dexmedetomodine (precedex) that produces an unconsciousness more similar to sleep and has been shown to reduce the risk of ICU delirium vs more common medications like propofol. It is also used as an adjunct in anesthetic practice. But it is not nearly as prominent as propofol or inhaled anesthetics for a few reasons. First, it takes longer to work so after a dose you have to wait 15-30min for it to take effect (propofol is within a minute or so) and it lasts longer once it is stopped. Additionally, up until recently it was on patent and quite expensive. The patent recently expired and it is seeing increased use but I doubt it will ever become as popular as propofol.  <br />EDIT: Precedex also isn't a full anesthetic in standard practice so for surgery under general anesthesia it still needs to be used with another medicine like propofol or anesthesia gas.  Thanks u/bluejay54 for the reminder.  <br />True ELI5: Sleep = charging your phone on airplane mode. Anesthesia = turning your phone off but not charging it. credit to u/greatpiginthesty<br />I am an ICU RN and am starting anesthesia training soon.",
    "answer2": "There is no clear consensus on whether or not people under anesthesia get the sleep they need for the day. Some studies suggest that people under anesthesia do get some sleep, but it is not clear how deep or restful this sleep is. Other studies suggest that people under anesthesia do not get any meaningful sleep at all. Therefore, it is difficult to say definitively whether or not people under anesthesia get the sleep they need for the day.",

    "answer1": "You're referring to somone who is dying from a grievous injury or overdose, and not of natural causes. <br />When alert the pituitary gland in the brain produces ACTH, vassopressin and cortisol, especially when one knows one is in danger. ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce adrenaline,  and norepinephrine.<br />Epinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, and cortisol all act to contract blood vessels and raise blood pressure.  The first two raise heart rate and increse breathing rate. Cortisol releases glucose from the liver. <br />This can all reduce blood loss from an injury. It can also prevent *shock* which is a catastrophic drop in blood pressure that can be difficult to reverse once it sets in. Untreated shock typically results in loss of oxygen to the brain resulting in brain injury and rapid death.<br />In the case of a drug overdose or alcohol poisoning this is important as it keeps the victim breathing.",

    "question_text": "Why do people go bald on the top of their head and still have some on the sides and not vice-versa?<br />",
    "answer1": "There are a few reasons why people go bald on the top of their head and still have some hair on the sides. One reason is that the hair follicles on the top of the head are more sensitive to a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is a byproduct of testosterone and is found in both men and women. When DHT levels are high, it can cause the hair follicles on the top of the head to miniaturize, which leads to hair loss. Another reason is that the hair on the sides and back of the head is not as exposed to the sun and other environmental factors, which can damage the hair and lead to hair loss.",
    "answer2": "Seems unsettled but here’s a theory:<br />“The most recent hypothesis suggests that the hair loss process begins during puberty, when growth of the skull and the muscles in the forehead and neck increases the tension in a tight band of tissue stretching over the top of the head. The more DHT (a type of testosterone) there is, the more these muscles contract, which causes inflammation and brings in more DHT. Over time, the DHT thickens the band of tissue, restricting the supply of blood and nutrients to the hair follicles above it. The follicles on top of the head get smaller and eventually disappear, while those on the sides of the head remain largely unaffected.”<br />Source<br />https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/why-do-men-go-bald-from-the-top-of-their-heads/",

I was watching a video on the depth of the ocean and it got me curious how deep sea creatures don't immediately squash under all that pressure. I did some reading on it and from what I saw, fish/squid/etc lack swim bladders and as a result lack anything left in their bodies to be compressed. Yet I'm still a bit confused on how these animals even open their mouths under all that weight.. how they have an open stomach. Wouldn't that be flattened as well? The only thing I could think of is that the pressure inside their bodies maybe equalize the pressure on the outside.<br />Which brings me the to the last part of the question. As a part of that video, I saw that a leatherback sea turtle has a maximum diving depth of 1,280 meters. Yet just before that it mentioned that the pressure that far down is roughly equivalent to a polar bear standing on a postage stamp. I can kind of overlook how fish do it, but I can't really imagine a polar bear standing on a sea turtle's face and it be just fine.

I mean, if a fertilized egg splits and the two fragments can form into two normal sized humans, wouldn't that mean if the egg never split, the single human would have the mass/size of the two twins combined?

Eggs are large by cell standards - they're about the size of the period at the end of this sentence if you're using a typical monitor - but they're much smaller than a fetus or newborn child.<br />And in fact, the fertilized egg *doesn't* typically split in half with identical twins. Instead, identical twins diverge a little later in development (a few days in) during the split between the cells that form the placenta and the cells that form what will eventually be the final human. A single layer of cells (called the *trophoblast*) forms the placenta, and inside that is a blob of cells (the \"inner cell mass\") that forms the embryo. In identical twins, *two* inner cell masses form instead of one. But at this point the placenta attaches to and begins receiving nutrients from the uterine wall.<br />So while the two embyros begin slightly smaller than they otherwise would, they have access to outside nutrients very early in development, and it's those outside nutrients that enable actual growth in size.",

    "answer2": "Dental tartar is hard because it is made up of minerals that have been deposited on the teeth. These minerals are mostly calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate, which are very hard. The bacteria in dental tartar also contribute to its hardness, as they produce a sticky substance that binds the tartar to the teeth.",

I know age and being in the sun a lot changes tattoos colour but I’ve always been super careful with tattoo specific sun screen when I’m outside. <br />I understand tattoos can “spread” over time but my other coloured tattoos still are the original colour, whereas the black mostly looks dark blue now.<br />Why is it that black “fades” so fast?",

    "answer2": "There are a few reasons why older black tattoos may look blue. First, as tattoos age, the ink can spread and become thinner, making the colors appear less saturated. Second, exposure to sunlight can cause tattoo ink to fade, and black ink is particularly susceptible to this. Finally, some inks contain pigments that are not very stable and can break down over time, resulting in a change in color.",

According to research, the tastes we perceive are a combination of both the sense of taste from our taste buds- clusters of sensory cells connected to nerve fibers that receive taste sensations- as well as the sense of smell. When your smell and taste nerves are stimulated, signals are sent to the brain, which translates those signals and identifies what you are tasting.(This process is explained well in answer A w.r.t the olfactory bulbs.) When we're sick, our noses are often blocked with mucus. Also, the tissues inside our nose can become swollen and inflamed. This prevents us from smelling properly. Because your sense of smell is so tied to your sense of taste, if you can't smell things properly, you won't be able to taste them properly, either.
