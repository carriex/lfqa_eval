Wouldn't they only have half of the normal mass/size of a single-child pregnancy? I mean, if a fertilized egg splits and the two fragments can form into two normal sized humans, wouldn't that mean if the egg never split, the single human would have the mass/size of the two twins combined? Does the cell somehow know that it split, and somehow it then knows that despite losing half of what it already had as a single egg, it needs to develop as if it never had the material from the portion that split off? Sorry if this sounds like rambling, but I can't find any information on this topic online.",
    "answer1": "The egg does not contain all the material of the final human being. Eggs are large by cell standards - they're about the size of the period at the end of this sentence if you're using a typical monitor - but they're much smaller than a fetus or newborn child.<br />And in fact, the fertilized egg *doesn't* typically split in half with identical twins. Instead, identical twins diverge a little later in development (a few days in) during the split between the cells that form the placenta and the cells that form what will eventually be the final human. A single layer of cells (called the *trophoblast*) forms the placenta, and inside that is a blob of cells (the \"inner cell mass\") that forms the embryo. In identical twins, *two* inner cell masses form instead of one. But at this point the placenta attaches to and begins receiving nutrients from the uterine wall.<br />So while the two embyros begin slightly smaller than they otherwise would, they have access to outside nutrients very early in development, and it's those outside nutrients that enable actual growth in size.",

I was watching a video on the depth of the ocean and it got me curious how deep sea creatures don't immediately squash under all that pressure. I did some reading on it and from what I saw, fish/squid/etc lack swim bladders and as a result lack anything left in their bodies to be compressed. Yet I'm still a bit confused on how these animals even open their mouths under all that weight.. how they have an open stomach. Wouldn't that be flattened as well? The only thing I could think of is that the pressure inside their bodies maybe equalize the pressure on the outside.<br />Which brings me the to the last part of the question. As a part of that video, I saw that a leatherback sea turtle has a maximum diving depth of 1,280 meters. Yet just before that it mentioned that the pressure that far down is roughly equivalent to a polar bear standing on a postage stamp. I can kind of overlook how fish do it, but I can't really imagine a polar bear standing on a sea turtle's face and it be just fine. I can't even imagine me being able to punch a sea turtle in the face and it being fine. Yet apparently it's somehow invincible.",

Without this, they would sink to the bottom of the ocean and be crushed by the pressure. Another reason is that they have a higher density than surface animals, which makes it harder for them to float. Finally, deep sea animals have adapted to the high pressure and cold temperatures of the deep ocean, and would not be able to survive in the warmer, shallower waters of the surface.",

    "answer1": "There are a few reasons why people go bald on the top of their head and still have some hair on the sides. One reason is that the hair follicles on the top of the head are more sensitive to a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is a byproduct of testosterone and is found in both men and women. When DHT levels are high, it can cause the hair follicles on the top of the head to miniaturize, which leads to hair loss. Another reason is that the hair on the sides and back of the head is not as exposed to the sun and other environmental factors, which can damage the hair and lead to hair loss.",
    "answer2": "Seems unsettled but here’s a theory:<br />“The most recent hypothesis suggests that the hair loss process begins during puberty, when growth of the skull and the muscles in the forehead and neck increases the tension in a tight band of tissue stretching over the top of the head. The more DHT (a type of testosterone) there is, the more these muscles contract, which causes inflammation and brings in more DHT. Over time, the DHT thickens the band of tissue, restricting the supply of blood and nutrients to the hair follicles above it. The follicles on top of the head get smaller and eventually disappear, while those on the sides of the head remain largely unaffected.”<br />Source<br />https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/why-do-men-go-bald-from-the-top-of-their-heads/",

In fact, patients in ICUs who are sedated for long periods of time with some of the same medications they use in anesthesia get delirium from both a lack of sleep and a lack of proper awake time. <br />This is also true for prescription benzodiazepines like Ativan (lorazepam) and Xanax (alprazolam) which are often prescribed for insomnia but do not produce true sleep. <br />There is an IV sedative called Dexmedetomodine (precedex) that produces an unconsciousness more similar to sleep and has been shown to reduce the risk of ICU delirium vs more common medications like propofol. It is also used as an adjunct in anesthetic practice. But it is not nearly as prominent as propofol or inhaled anesthetics for a few reasons. First, it takes longer to work so after a dose you have to wait 15-30min for it to take effect (propofol is within a minute or so) and it lasts longer once it is stopped. Additionally, up until recently it was on patent and quite expensive. The patent recently expired and it is seeing increased use but I doubt it will ever become as popular as propofol.  <br />EDIT: Precedex also isn't a full anesthetic in standard practice so for surgery under general anesthesia it still needs to be used with another medicine like propofol or anesthesia gas.  Thanks u/bluejay54 for the reminder.  <br />True ELI5: Sleep = charging your phone on airplane mode. Anesthesia = turning your phone off but not charging it. credit to u/greatpiginthesty<br />I am an ICU RN and am starting anesthesia training soon.",
    "answer2": "There is no clear consensus on whether or not people under anesthesia get the sleep they need for the day. Some studies suggest that people under anesthesia do get some sleep, but it is not clear how deep or restful this sleep is. Other studies suggest that people under anesthesia do not get any meaningful sleep at all. Therefore, it is difficult to say definitively whether or not people under anesthesia get the sleep they need for the day.",

    "answer2": "There are a few reasons why older black tattoos may look blue. First, as tattoos age, the ink can spread and become thinner, making the colors appear less saturated. Second, exposure to sunlight can cause tattoo ink to fade, and black ink is particularly susceptible to this. Finally, some inks contain pigments that are not very stable and can break down over time, resulting in a change in color.",

When we taste food, part of the taste sensation comes from smelling the particles.
