    "question_text": "What's the deal with concubines in Ancient China?  How were they selected?  Were any selected from the common classes or were they generally from upper class families?  Was it shameful or a great honor for your daughter or sister to be selected as a concubine?",
    "answer1": "In terms of what's the deal, I wrote a bit about [why a monogamous Emperor might not be a practical option](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l5b0m4/were_concubines_mandatory_to_have_in_imperial/gl44xim/) but in short, political ties to important families, increasing chances of children, cosmology to reflect Heaven and good medical practice with balancing yin and yang.<br />The later Han's selection process was that an officer of the imperial household and a eunuch, accompanied by a physiognomist, toured the capital area. They looked for ladies of virtue, beauty and respectable background (no crimes, magic, medicine, trade, handcraft) of between 13-20 sui. Leading families could either present their daughters to the inspectors or make arrangements to skip that, controllers and Dowagers inserting their own candidates (who just happened to be related). Also not unknown for an Emperor in the civil war when Han Empire collapsed  to spot someone they fancied, marriage via conquest, a \"we are sorry we rebelled, have this lady\"<br />In terms of background, the Later Han had background restrictions and any uncertainty, like with the He family who was the first from outside a certain seven families, could lead to rumours. But the Wei dynasty Empresses included a songstress (granted she became Empress after her husband died), an orphan servant (this led to some protest), a carriage maker's daughter (some sneering and protest), one from good background sent as a \"sorry we rebelled\". Policy towards those on the poor families depended on the dynasty, which families they wished to be aligned to, if they wanted to keep a distance from powerful families but there would be people from aristocratic backgrounds.<br />I'm unaware of anybody who felt it was shameful for their relative to enter the imperial harem. An ally inside the imperial palaces wasn't a bad thing,  but an Emperor or controller might not be too keen for someone from the greatest families to have someone inside the harem and potentially getting too powerful or influential.<br />Sources: Fire Over Luoyang by Rafe De Crespigny<br />Empress and Consorts by Robert Cutter and William Cromwell",
    "answer2": "A concubine was a woman in ancient China who was sexually available to a man other than her husband.  A man could have multiple concubines, but his wife was considered primary.  Concubines were generally selected from among the upper classes, and it was considered a great honor for a woman to be selected as a concubine.",

    "question_text": "I was wondering if there was any historical references of a Leader employing a humanitarian crisis as a trap for an invading force in the way that the fictional character Marco Inaros succeeded to do on the Expanse?<br />Spoiler for anyone who intends on watching season 6, episode 3 of the Expanse, but I want to find if this was uniquely fictitious or if there’s very real historical events I could also explore. Without needing to see the Expanse, I will give a quick run down of what happened:<br />As two navies fight for control in space, Earth vs the Outer Belt “Free Navy,” the Earth force intends to invade the Capitol city of Ceres station. It was important to establish a foothold in future attacks. Upon arrival, the invaders find that the city has been stripped of all food and supplies, and the residents left with only a few weeks of food before they would starve to death. What appeared to be an effortless victory ended as a humanitarian crisis draining resources and entrapping the Earth navy in a PR nightmare instead of decisive victory. <br />Has this ever been deployed in real life? Maybe in WWII with the prison camps or possibly (and if it’s against the rules to mention, please skip), but modern times fall of Baghdad in the recent war in Iraq be considered a similar ploy? I doubted anything before mass media or before the value of life became more culturally valued — I could see barbaric or even crusade or colonizing invaders cutting down local peasants without concern for life.",
    "answer1": "That’s is super interesting. Definitely not on purpose but had a similar effect. That’s awesome. I’m going to keep the thread open for any other historical references but I do appreciate this and it’s 1 more than I expected to get",
    "answer2": "I mean, it was definitely not intentional, but as Confederate armies retreated from the banks of the Mississippi, along which some of the South's wealthiest and largest plantations were located, the Union was left guarding an enormous expanse, filled with tens of thousands of freedmen that desperately needed food, medicine and clothing. This created a giant humanitarian crisis that the Union Army was ill-equipped to handle. Their best attempts were to put the freedmen into \"Contraband Camps\" that were rife with disease and unsanitary conditions. Another approach was to lease abandoned and confiscated plantations to Northern factors, who would then employ the freedmen to grow cotton. But in any case the crisis was never completely solved, and it proved to be a constant drain in Union resources and manpower, an embarrassment for the Lincoln administration, and a military factor in that the need to patrol the territory diverted thousands of troops and occasionally had adverse effects in military operations. <br />However, this was not an intentional ploy on the part of the Confederates. If they had gotten their way the Union would never have occupied those territories, and the people they enslaved would have remained in their plantations under their control. The freedmen who remained and thus came under Union protection did so not because of the Confederates but in spite of them, as they refused to flee with their masters. Instead, they abandoned the plantations and entered Union lines, or alternately, knowing that the Union would soon take control of the plantation, remained there, defying attempts to \"refugee\" them. Moreover, most of the outrage in reaction of the terrible conditions in the camps came from Northern abolitionists - people the Southerners despised.",

But there was a trench warfare scene that caught my eye.<br />Essentially Germans and English send scouting parties to no man’s land. The two meet and, using sign language, agree that gunfire will mean the end of all of them. They all put down their firearms and proceed to quietly engage in vicious knife/club fighting. Of course when someone finally breaks down and uses a pistol the trenches on either side erupt with gun fire killing almost all involved parties.<br />Any accuracy to this? Quiet hand-to-hand combat in no man’s land.",
    "answer1": "Shortly, yes . Scouting missions into No Man's Land did happen and were undertaken with stealth and little firearms. Melee weapons such as clubs, hatchets, and sharpened entrancing tools were common place weapons and there is even evidence of spears being used in assaults.  German forces, as well as some Allied units, utilized armor for scouting missions as well. <br />In fact, there were entire German squads outfitted with melee weapons and armor that carried out nighttime missions and specialized trench attacks thought the Western Front.

    "question_text": "What does the term \"metal road/metaled road\" mean and where did it come from? I have frequently seen it in archeology reports, or when Brits are speaking. I presume it to mean an improved road of some sort like gravel or paved road as opposed to a plain dirt road.",
    "answer1": "The term \"metal road/metaled road\" is used to describe an improved road surface that is made up of compacted materials like gravel, stone, or pavement. This type of road surface is typically found in areas with high traffic volume or in locations where the natural soil conditions are not suitable for a paved road. In some cases, metal roads can also refer to roads that are coated with a layer of asphalt or other bituminous materials. <br />The term \"metal road\" is believed to have originated in the early 19th century, when roads were first being improved with compacted materials like gravel and stone. At that time, the use of metal (usually iron or steel) was also becoming more common in road construction, as it was used to reinforce the roadbed or to create drainage ditches alongside the road. Over time, the term \"metal road\" came to be used as a general term for any improved road surface, regardless of the materials used. <br />Today, the term \"metal road/metaled road\" is still used in many parts of the world, particularly in Britain, to describe an improved road surface. In some cases, the term is used interchangeably with \"paved road\" or \"tarred road.\" However, in other cases, it may be used to specifically describe a road that is made up of compacted materials like gravel or stone, or a road that is coated with a layer of asphalt or other bituminous material.",
    "answer2": "I’m far from an expert, but decided to look this up a bit. At first, I expected to it be related to “via feratta”, italian for iron path.

    "question_text": "Has there been any battles in history where both sides were completely and mutually destroyed?",
    "answer1": "In normal conditions, this would not happen, since casualty rates in historical battles are rarely that extreme. In ancient warfare the defeated side might incur something like 10-20% casualties unless things went disastrously wrong. In modern warfare a unit that has lost more than 30% effectives is considered unfit for action.<br />Most of the time, the deciding factor is morale. Warriors simply aren't going to keep on fighting when they see their buddies falling left and right and they see no way of turning things around. They're going to try to get out of there, find a place of safety, and regroup if they can; or they're going to surrender. When the situation is hopeless, most armies will give up the fight, and this will happen long before they come anywhere near total annihilation. In fact, in premodern warfare the great majority of casualties were sustained when the side that broke first was fleeing from the battlefield with the victorious side in hot pursuit.<br />So, given these conditions, what would you need to achieve mutual destruction? You'd need two sides that were roughly evenly matched and utterly determined never to give up. The necessary attitude may sometimes be found among the last defenders of a town or fortress, but of course you would never get two such forces fighting each other; in most cases where one side is prepared to fight to the end, the other side is vastly superior and not similarly inclined. The result would be either the annihilation of the defenders or the flight of the attackers - never mutual destruction.<br />There is one case from Greek history that meets your requirements, though, by virtue of being artificially created and utterly exceptional: the so-called Battle of the Champions, fought around 550 BC between the Spartans and the Argives (Herodotos 1.82). When the two armies met, they agreed to settle their dispute over a border region by each choosing 300 champions, and letting those men fight it out. It seems these picked forces were a match for each other, because all 600 men died, except for two Argives and one Spartan. At that point the two Argives left the battlefield and declared themselves victorious. The Spartan stayed behind, stripped the dead of their armour, and declared himself victorious. <br />There is no other example of a prearranged battle like this in Greek history. The reason is obvious: it was a complete failure, since the two sides couldn't agree on who had won, and in the end they decided to launch their whole armies into an all-out battle anyway. But because of the artificial conditions and the dedication of the 600 champions, it's the closest a battle ever got to complete destruction on both sides.",
    "answer2": "There have been a few instances in history where both sides in a battle were completely and mutually destroyed. One example is the Battle of Cannae during the Second Punic War, in which the Carthaginian forces led by Hannibal annihilated a much larger Roman army. Another example is the Battle of Agincourt during the Hundred Years' War, in which the English forces led by Henry V defeated a much larger French army.",

Madison was the consummate deal maker, and it's easy to imagine the story originating with him. <br /> But Andrew Jackson was the most notorious practitioner of awarding posts to friends:  before him, chances were at least pretty good that a Federalist would be able to keep his job if a Democratic President came to power. But Jackson wanted a bureaucracy loyal to him, correctly saw that rewarding office seekers with positions was a way to gain political support in their regions, and was quick to terminate people in order to get it. By Lincoln's administration, it was very much expected that a there would be a major turnover in positions coming in with his election, so your story was certainly a joke- a wry one, as Lincoln had plenty of men hanging about the White House getting in his way, hoping for just such a chance.  But the joke had a point, both for Madison and Lincoln- there had to be a quid pro quo, as the office seeker was expected to bring some local influence, bring the support of a Congressman, an electoral district; something useful. A man without influence might well only be able to beg for a pair of pants.<br />Real civil service reform was begun by Garfield, and after he was shot by an office seeker, carried on to everyone's surprise by  Chester A.

    "answer1": "An early form of joint stock ventures appeared in Assyria by the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE. There does not seem to have been any noticeable pushback against the concept, although trade caravans were often taxed heavily. Of course, the relevant texts were written to and from people engaged in trade, so there's no way of knowing what other Assyrians thought of long distance trade. <br />>Most of these traders had become more independent by having become managers of a \"joint-stock fund\" (called *naruqqum*, \"money bag\"), usually set up in Assur. This phenomenon appeared for the first time around 1900 BC and seems to have been an Old Assyrian invention that went beyond individual partnerships and cooperation in a joint caravan. The arrangement, rather similar to that of the early medieval *compagnia*, meant enlisting a number (usually about a dozen) of investors (*ummiānum*, \"financiers\"), who supplied capital rated in gold, usually in all ca. 30 kilos, ideally consisting of shares of 1 or 2 kilos of gold each. It was entrusted to a trader (the tractator), usually for ca. ten years, for the generally formulated purpose of \"carrying out trade.\" The contract contained stipulations on a final settlement of accounts, on paying dividends, on the division of the expected profit, and on fines for premature withdrawal of capital (meant to secure the duration of the business). Investors or shareholders mostly lived in Assur, but successful traders in Anatolia too invested in funds managed by others, perhaps also as a way of sharing commercial risks. In such cases a contract would to be drawn up in Anatolia that obliged the tractator \"to book in Assur x gold in his joint stock fund in the investor's name.\" Among the investors we find members of the tractator's family, but also business relations and others, probably a kind of \"merchant-bankers,\" and other rich citizens, who aimed at fairly safe, long-term investments.<br />[\"Ancient Assur: The City, its Traders, and its Commercial Network\"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25651212) by Klaas Veenhof<br />For more on Old Assyrian trade and these early joint stock funds, see [*Ancient Kanesh: A Merchant Colony in Bronze Age Anatolia*](https://books.google.com/books?id=qXGgCgAAQBAJ) by Mogens Larsen.",

However, I can't find any reliable sources on exactly how these firearms were protected. Some say they were blued, others that they just slapped on a load of radiator paint. Still others talk about anodising but that seems unlikely to me based on examples I've seen. I've also heard that they simply weren't protected at all, notably with the Sten gun.",
    "answer1": "As you likely have noticed, there are LOTS of ways to blue a firearm. What makes it confusing is that both browning and blueing are making an iron oxide layer, and a blued finish will, on exposure to the elements ( like, someone goes hunting) bit by bit revert to regular brown rust, so quite a lot of guns are now brown that were once blue ( there's a gunsmith invocation over blueing: \"from rust you came, to rust you shall return\"). <br />In the later 1800's it was discovered that a phosphate coating could be created that was more stable than blueing or browning. The patent history is a bit complex, but the process was made practical after 1900, and in 1918 the Parker Rust-Proof Company started up in Detroit. Because of them , the finish has since generally been called parkerizing, and it was adopted by Springfield Armory and contractors as the standard finish on US small arms in WWII, like the Garand, the 1911A1 automatic pistol, the 1903A3 rifle.  I'm afraid I don't know if any other countries used it, however: I think a blued finish was the most common elsewhere. <br />Even though the patents have long expired, the Parker Company still exists, and has a [website](https://www.parkerhq.com/about-us)<br />Angier, R. H. (2021). Firearm Blueing & Browning (First Edition). Stackpole Co.   ( I should note, here, that Angier's book, the classic reference,  is from 1936. It is  still in print)",
    "answer2": "There is some debate over the protective finishes used on firearms during WWI and WWII. Some say that the firearms were blued, while others claim that they were simply painted with radiator paint. Still others believe that the firearms were anodized, though this seems unlikely based on examples that have been found. It is also possible that the firearms were not protected at all, as was the case with the Sten gun.",

    "question_text": "I have read on this subreddit before that it was not unheard of for medieval nuns writing about Jesus and God in very erotic, or seemingly erotic, terms. I was wondering if there is any compiled lists of this medieval thirst poetry or what are some more famous examples of it?",
    "answer1": "Yes, this was absolutely a thing – and a reasonably widespread thing at that. Quite a lot of medieval religious women practiced aversion of mystical theology which incorporated a significant erotic element. This tended to revolve around casting Jesus as a bridegroom figure, with whomthe mystic envisioned themselves achieving spiritual, mystical union with. It’s worth noting that it was by no means only women practicing this kind of spiritual experience. Indeed, one of the most prominent examples of this practice is St Bernard of Clairvaux’s (1090-1153) sermons on the Song of Songs, in which he makes use of strongly sexualised imagery to describe union with Christ (and then promptly chastises his audience for their dirty minds – good consistentapproach there Bernard, A+).<br />However, it’s certainly the women who are the most famous for this practice, and it does seem to have been a largely female (andcertainly feminised) form of mysticism. To the best of my knowledge, there’s not a compiled list, simply because there’s a huge amount of the stuff. Poetry is prominent, but there’s also many prose accounts of mystical visions and experiences. There is an (important) caveat that the actual writer of these experiences can differ – in some cases it is the mystic herself, but in many other it’s a male (usually mendicant) confessor or spiritual director. This can be a very significant filter on the voice that we can access, and can play a part in homogenising or “flattening” the texts.<br />In terms of the content, “thirst poetry” is an interesting modern analogy, but it’s important to remember that the erotic content of works like this is (at least theoretically) very much the means to the end, which is complete and total union with the divine. Much mystical theology works in an apophatic way – this means that God is conceptualised as the ultimate negative, completely unknown and unknowable. Due to this fundamentally unreachable nature, a variety of intellectual strategies are employed to try and bridge this epistemological gap, of which the use of the erotic mode of expression is just one. It’s also worth noting that one could quite equally look at some of this “erotic” language and categorise it as being about violent behaviour instead. See for example Beatrice of Nazareth’s description of love:<br />*“Meantime, when love acts in the heart so vehemently and riotously, it becomes so excessive and exuberant in the soul that the soul thinks its heart has been wounded in many and grave ways.... So it seems that its veins are opened and its blood is boiling out, its marrow is withered and its legs are weak, its chest burns and its throat is dry.... And the soul thus feels love acting riotously within it, sparing nothing, uncontrollably seizing and consuming everything within the soul like a devouring fire…”*<br />Or Mechthild of Magdeburg’s description of the union with the Godhead:<br />*“She is captured in the first experience*  <br />*When God kisses her in sweet union.*  <br />*She is assailed with many a holy thought*  <br />*That she not waver when she mortifies her flesh.*  <br />*She is bound by the power of the Holy Spirit,*  <br />*And her bliss is indeed manifold.*  <br />*She is slapped with the great powerlessness*  <br />*Of not being able to enjoy without interruption eternal light”*<br />I’m not saying these works are *about* violence specifically, just that they’re not either uncomplicatedly erotic, or using eroticism as the primary meaning of the text.<br />Famous examples – probably the most widely known these days are Margery Kempe (experiencing something of a renaissance recently) and St Catherine of Siena. Examples do, however, multiply - Dorothea of Montau, Marguerite Porete, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch of Antwerp – the list goes on. I’d suggest that Kempe and St Catherine are probably the easiest to find editions of the complete text, though I’d not swear to that.<br />If you want some good reading on the subject, a classic text is C. Walker-Bynum, *Fragmentation and Redemption* (New York: Zone Books, 1992). A broader (and possibly more accessible) work is E. A. Petroff (ed), *Medieval Women’s Visionary Literature*, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986). There is a wealth of more recent writing on the topic, but those are good starting points.<br />Edit: formatting. Jesus, reddit.",

    "question_text": "A medieval household and village produced a lot of ash, what would they do with all of it?<br />Ash can be good for gardens but too much ash, there's a lot of lye and salts put into the soil and it will burn up the root systems.",
    "answer1": "That's what ash-holes (or ash-pits)  are good for:[https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/ash-hole-ash-pit](https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/ash-hole-ash-pit)<br />Archeologists love ashholes as a lot of other stuff got thrown in there as well.   <br />Here is an interesting  article, aptly named \"Have you tried the ash pit\" that discusses an ash-pit excavation in Ireland in detail: [https://www.academia.edu/42316558/Have\\_you\\_tried\\_the\\_ash\\_pit](https://www.academia.edu/42316558/Have_you_tried_the_ash_pit)",
    "answer2": "A medieval household might use ash in the garden, but too much ash can be harmful. Ash can contain high levels of lye and salts, which can burn plant roots.",

    "BetterAnswer": "Answer A",
    "DifficultToChoose": "No.",
    "comments": "Answer A is the better answer as it provides relevant academic information and does not repeat the question. The question itself does not have any false assumptions, as the information they point out is relevant. There are no major grammar mistakes in either answer. The answers are not convoluted and are straightforward. Answer B contains irrelevant information as it repeats part of the question with [Ash can contain high levels of lye and salts, which can burn plant roots]. The question itself already points that out and it is repetitive for the answer to mention it. Answer B has a lack of information, it seems that they are guessing rather than having sources to back their claim. Answer A's links provide relevant information to their answer and upon reading the article linked, their answer is sufficiently backed up. Answer A is correct and has the historical information to support its claim.  ",
