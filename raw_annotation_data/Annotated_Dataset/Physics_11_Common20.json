    "question_text": "If opposite poles attract, why does the North side of a compass point north instead of south? ",
    "answer1": "The reason that the north side of a compass points north instead of south is because opposite poles attract each other. The north pole of the compass is attracted to the south pole of the earth, and vice versa. This interaction between the poles is what causes the compass needle to point in a particular direction.",
    "answer2": "The opposite electrical charges attract. There's nothing that actually matters about how we label them as North and South. For a compass, we've made it so the side that points to the magnetic north pole is labeled as North.",
    "answer1_label": "HMM[2]",

    "BetterAnswer": "Answer A",
    "DifficultToChoose": "No.",
    "comments": "As per answer B, the word opposite electrical charges may seem vague. Why because, in fact the opposite poles North and South are in fact magnetic poles. However answer A is clear in this regard. In defining magnetic poles of the Earth, the Earth's south magnetic pole is near Earth's geographic north. Earth's magnetic north pole is near Earth's geographic south. That's why the north pole of a compass points toward north because that's where Earth's south magnetic pole is located and they attract. This is brought about in answer A.\n That is to be further clarified as follows.  In fact magnetic  compass does not point to the geographic north pole. Essentially,  a magnetic compass points to the earth's magnetic poles, which are not the same as earth's geographic poles. Furthermore, the magnetic pole near earth's geographic north pole is actually the south magnetic pole. When it comes to magnets, opposites attract.  As per answer A, \"The north pole of the compass is attracted to the south pole of the earth, and vice versa. This interaction between the poles is what causes the compass needle to point in a particular direction.\" it is clearly indicated.\nThis fact means that the north end of a magnet in a compass is attracted to the south magnetic pole, which lies close to the geographic north pole. Hypothetically, the magnetic field lines exit from the magnetic North pole and enters from the South magnetic pole.  This is further explained in the website \"https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/education/resources/k-8/science \nactivities/characteristicsofmaterials/magnetsmetals/magnets-point-the-way-science-for-kids.pdf\". It explains that, \"Earth's south magnetic pole is near Earth's geographic north. Earth's magnetic north pole is near Earth's geographic south. That's why the north pole of a compass points toward north because that's where Earth's south magnetic pole is located and they attract.\"\nSo it is not difficult to be separated between two answers A and B",

It has advantages over other power sources in terms of carbon emissions. However nuclear power plants pose several threats in terms of implementation. As answer A suggests Nuclear power plants have an instinct disadvantage of producing radioactive leakages. These leakages can be harmful to human beings so generally the plants are located in remote locations from human habitat, Further to answer A, Secondly, there is also a challenge in terms of disposing radioactive material. These radioactive material residues have to be dumped securely without harming the environment. Otherwise it can pollute the environment and can be a source of pollution. In terms of nuclear energy, the cost of energy in terms of units and running cost is less. Nevertheless cost of implementation is too high.\nSince, answer A is straight on this fact, Answer A is selected over answer B",

This is my account to support answer B further. Actually, there will be molecular interaction without touching each other. It is simple to visualize example of air. How sound waves are propagated through air will be an ideal example to visualize how sound waves are propagated through a medium, without atoms being in contact. Actually when sound waves are generated there are compressions and rarefactions that propagate the sound waves through a particular medium. So it is not merely atom to atom, but rather a collection of atoms. Atoms collectively in collaboration produce a region where there is a compression and a rarefaction. In that way, there will be transfer of sound energy. Similarly in other mediums too there will be relative movement of molecule rather than the atom itself.\nActually there will be an electron cloud surrounding an atom too. That will basically behave as an electron cloud. Answer A doesn't provide a comprehensive explanation neither the answer B.

One reason is that when the pitcher or carafe is full, the weight of the water can cause the spout to open slightly, which allows water to drip or spill out. Another reason is that when the container is full, the water level is higher than the spout, so the water has to travel further to reach the spout, which can cause it to spill or dribble out.

When water is poured out from a full pitcher/carafe, then water tends to cling on to the solid. This is highlighted in answer A in simple day to day words. But we know that surface tension forces are weaker molecular bonds. Once water starts to pour out or when liquid is starting to flow faster, there is no more tendency for these molecules to cling on to. Therefore, overcoming these weaker molecular attraction forces, liquid tend to pour rather than dribbling or dripping along the surface.

    "answer1": "Sunlight carries with it energy. About a thousand watts per square meter on a good day. A 6-cm magnifying glass takes up about 0.28% of a square meter, so it will be collecting around 2.8 watts of power - that's about a fifth of a small candle. It is concentrated down to a very small area - smaller than a candle flame, and so as far as that small area is concerned, it may as well be held over a flame.",
    "answer2": "A magnifying glass works by gathering the light from a larger area and focussing it into a smaller area. When using a magnifying glass normally, you're taking the light bouncing off the thing you're looking at and focussing it into your eye-hole.<newline>If you bring a magnifying glass outside on a sunny day, [this happens](https://i.imgur.com/sJxraPg.png). All the sunlight (and heat energy) that hits the whole large surface of the magnifying glass gets focused and concentrated to be hitting a MUCH smaller point. So like, if you focus the power onto a spot 1/100th the size of the glass itself, that spot gets 100x more heat on it than just being in normal sunlight. Also notice you're not creating energy here. The hot spot gets a shadow around it.

Further according to answer B, this is simply because of the thermal energy concentrated by the magnifying glass. This is according to the refraction principle of light waves.

But Answer A compares all the factors that can lead to this scenario.\nAccording to answer A, Actually, in a turn, a car negotiates a circular path. When a vehicle is in circular motion, there should be certain parameters that should be conducive, in order to have described a proper circular path. For an example, there should be sufficient force acting towards the center when the car is in a turn, if there is not enough force towards the center car would either slip or skid. If force towards is less then it would tend to slip towards the center. On the contrary, if the car has a greater speed what can be accommodated during a turn,  then the car would tend to skid and jump out of the turn. As such, there is a tendency for the car to lose control if there is a steering input while the car is in a skid or a slip with the combination of brakes. As the answer A explains, there can be more conditions which attribute to this. They can be \"surface condition, oversteer, understeer, condition of the tyres, cornering speed\". According to \"https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a30913/how-to-not-spin/\" there are more conditions given. The provision of the centrifugal force is provided by many factors such as banking or friction force on the race tracks.

A smaller object will reach terminal velocity more quickly, but it won’t go as fast. These two things exist on a parabola where there’s a lot of overlap because there’s often not a large enough free fall. Example of physics, an average sized human’s free fall terminal velocity is about 85-90mph, but a streamlined human can get to well over 100, and a human wearing specific clothing/attire can get even faster in a fall.

In order this gravitational force to experience a big difference, the height that we consider should be greater. However as mentioned in Answer B it will make a comparatively big difference if we consider the drag force due to air resistance. If the mass of an object is greater, then the air resistance encountered is greater by the heavier object. If the mass of an object is lesser, then the air resistance by the lighter mass is lesser.

There are a few different things that can do this function, even just water.<newline>To control the reaction so they can make it happen more slowly over time instead of releasing all that insane energy at once, things such as control rods (which instead absorb neutrons instead of just slowing them down) are also put in the reactor.<newline>All this neutron whizzing about breaking other atoms like a cue ball on a pool table creates heat, crazy amounts of heat. This is captured via what is called the primary loop, which is water that is being circulated through the reactor both to help keep it cool and to collect that heat. This then goes to an exchanger where the primary water heats up secondary water (you don't want the primary water which is being exposed to neutron radiation to be outside the containment), and this secondary water gets turned into steam. This is what actually drives the steam turbines.<newline>Tldr: Nuclear reactions are atoms losing pieces that bump into other atoms and make them break up too, this makes shitloads of heat.

Enriched uranium is the fuel for nuclear power plants. In a nuclear reaction, two nuclei or one nucleus and another sub atomic particle collide to form one or more nuclides. In nuclear power plants nuclear fission process is explained. In terms of the comprehensive answer to cover all the required ingredients are provided in answer B. Answer A doesn't exclusively discuss about nuclear energy as a whole. Answer A concentrates more on the nuclear reactions rather than nuclear power and energy. Answer B covers both aspects of nuclear power and nuclear energy.\nFurther adding to Answer B, reactors use uranium for nuclear fuel. The uranium is processed into small ceramic pellets and stacked together into sealed metal tubes called fuel rods. Typically, more than 200 of these rods are bundled together to form a fuel assembly. A reactor core is typically made up of a couple hundred assemblies, depending on power level. (https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nuclear-101-how-does-nuclear-reactor-work). Answer B also accounts for how the generation of power is achieved in a nuclear power plant. Considering these aspects answer B is considered to be the better answer.",

    "question_text": "How is energy conserved when two forces counteract? If there are 2 forces on the same object, that counteract, the object doesn't move.<br />But there was energy released to create these forces. If these forces don't cause anything to move, doesn't it mean that that energy was destroyed?",
    "answer1": "Applying perfectly opposite forces in a perfectly static and rigid world - doesn't actually expend any energy. The act of applying a force doesn't expend energy - its the act of applying a force over a distance which does.<newline>In the real world, since everything is elastic, the thing you are compressing/stretching with your forces, plus the structure that the forces are reacting against will act like stiff springs - and this is where the energy gets stored.<newline>For example press your hands together in front of your chest. As you press:<newline>* Some energy gets stored into the squishing of your palms<newline>* Some energy gets stored in the compression of the bones in your forearms<newline>* Some energy gets stored in the tension of your upper arms and the bones across your shoulders<newline>The chances are some energy will be lost to heat, since flesh is unlikely to be a particularly efficient elastic. <newline>Since you don't apply the force over much distance, very little energy is stored. If you put a spring between your hands, now you apply the force over more distance and more energy is stored (which is apparent when you let the spring go!)",
    "answer2": "Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one type to another. In this case, the energy was converted from potential energy to kinetic energy and then back to potential energy.

And further answer A adds that \"its the act of applying a force over a distance which does expand energy.\" Therefore since no work is done since there is no movement of the object. \nAnswer B basically, revolves around energy. When it comes to answer A and B in terms of balancing the context of the question, there is solid grounds to provide that answer A has provided a better explanation.\nIn actual terms, although there is energy being exerted to apply a force, there is no work done since there is no movement. In physics principle there is no energy expelled. This is in accordance with principles of physics. Further there will only be work done if there is movement of an object over a distance and then we can consider that there is certain amount of energy associated with it. \nIn overall aspects, answer A provides a better explanation of this particular concept.\n",

As mentioned in answer A, \"The main reason why we can't dispose of nuclear waste by shooting it into deep space is because it would be incredibly expensive to do so.\". This is again mentioned in answer B. Nuclear waste still has certain amount of radioactivity left in it. Therefore its disposal has to be secured and non harming to the inhabitants. Moreover the process has to be cost effective. In terms of cost incurred in shooting nuclear waste in to sun or space, it is far more costly than that can be afforded. More the weight, higher would be the cost. Therefore it is required to have a mechanism to dump nuclear waste in a manner in which it is not harming to the species. There is an element of danger also associated to it also. Firstly if during launch, there is a misfire or failure there is a risk of falling back to earth. Secondly, during orbiting there can be a hazard of nuclear waste falling back to earth. So considering all those aspects it is not the feasible option. This is mentioned in answer \"A\". \"Additionally, there is no guarantee that the waste would not eventually come back to Earth, potentially causing harm to our planet and its inhabitants.\".

However, what is interesting is that there are several observations that the Big Bang *cannot* explain, such as:<newline>\\- why was the universe \"born\" perfectly flat?<newline>\\- why is the universe the same temperature (up to over 99% accuracy) in all directions when there hasn't been enough time for the temperature of the universe to \"even out\" all the way?<newline>\\- why aren't there various high-energy relics (like magnetic monopoles - a magnet that's only North or South, but *not both*) when the Standard Model (the current frame work of the smallest particles in physics) predicted that such relics should exist as a result of the insanely high energy of the Big Bang?<newline>\\- why did the universe begin with such low entropy (which is a measure of \"disorder\" in a system)? Especially considering the fact that entropy always increases in closed systems?<newline>After the Big Bang model became accepted in the first half of the 1900's, scientists have struggled to answer these questions above according to the framework of the Big Bang.<newline>However, in the '70s and '80s a scientist named Alan Guth came up with a model explains everything the Big Bang did, *and* also explains the unsolved observations not accounted by the Big Bang. This model is known as cosmic inflation, and put simply it is the idea that the energy in the first moments of universe wasn't in particles or radiation, but in the fabric of space itself. So what happened *before* the Big Bang is that the fabric of space itself began to exponentially inflate to an unimaginable degree, and we call the \"Big Bang\" is actually the end of this inflationary period.<newline>So then that begs the question: what happened before the inflationary period? Sadly, no one knows. It is possible that some kind of singularity existed before inflation. It is also possible that inflation never stopped, which would imply the existence of a multiverse. Or it could be that inflations happen cyclically, which implies an eternal universe.<newline>What's really interesting here is that the scientists who figured out and basically proved that inflation came first did this forty years ago.

It was apparent, even in the visuals the impact of the two aircrafts to the building has transferred huge momentum to the two buildings. Since the kinetic energy possessed by the aircrafts due to hundreds of tons of weight flying at considerable speed  had ultimately transferred to the building in terms of excessive kinetic energy. As a result of which, the kinetic energy had eventually being dissipated in to heat energy which was absorbed by the concrete and metal structure of the building. Due to the heat generated by this kinetic energy transfer and heat dissipated to the structure had resulted in melting of the concrete & metal structure and the building.

If you apply a force, it inherently *must* change an object's velocity (however slightly) and does not change its mass.<newline>To increase the momentum of an object, you must decrease the momentum of another object, as momentum is a conserved quantity.

So fast that it keeps pace with bullets. The enemy fires upon the aircraft, but the bullets can only match speeds with it and will not damage it.

An example would be an object that is stationary on a rough surface would remain stationary until it is acted upon by an overwhelming force. Example given in answer A is a bit obscure also and comparatively in answer B the explanation of rocket seems to be assuming. In answer B the particle accelerator example in modern physics also a good explanation too. Answer B seems to be simple and straight forward in that sense.\nStrictly speaking in terms of physics concepts, the force is the change in momentum per unit time. i.e rate of change in momentum. According to the Newton's second law, the force is equal to the rate of change of momentum. Usually, in classical mechanics, we consider the mass of an object to be constant. Therefore when a force is applied the rate of change of momentum occurs courtesy, the rate of change of velocity. In other words, when a force is applied, a particular object is subjected to acceleration or deceleration. But in certain cases, when the velocity is remained constant, the mass can vary. For an example, in an example of a rocket, due to fuel burn the mass decreases, but the velocity is held constant. This is in accordance with the second law of Newton. According to Answer B, \"with the hovering rocket example as well as the mass is reduced due to fuel being burned by the engines requiring less force to keep the same acceleration\". This may be the case in examples of moving bomber examples also. where the force applied is to maintain the speed of the bomber a constant despite the bombs dropped attributes to reduction of mass.\nHowever in answer B \"However /u/LordSpazpatty\" is not clear. it must be a quote.",
