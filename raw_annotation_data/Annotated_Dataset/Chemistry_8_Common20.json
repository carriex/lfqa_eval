    "answer1": "Most bug sprays work by using chemicals that are toxic to insects. When the bug comes into contact with the spray, the chemicals will kill the bug.",
    "answer2": "It's a poison, and since bugs are tiny it takes way less poison to kill them than it would a human. A lot of times the chemicals are just destructive to tissue. Imagine you get sprayed in the face by a water hose. Some of that water's going to go in your mouth and up your nose. Now imagine instead of water, it's a toxin that destroys cell tissue. The hose stops, you gasp for breath, and your lungs start scarring as the vapor dissolves them. Or it could be a neurotoxin that disrupts your nerves so effectively the signals for your heart to beat stop working.  One squirt from a can of bug spray covers that bug with our equivalent of a swimming pool of toxins. They inevitably end up breathing in and ingesting some, and it causes catastrophic damage to their internal organs or paralyzes them.",

    "question_text": "Why do most medicines have a side-effect? I've been drinking some meds and it was really annoying to experience the side effects. Can't we make all medicine have no side-effects? Follow up question; Does it not get affected or dissolve in our stomach?",
    "answer1": "The chemical reactions in your body are set and unchanging. It is impossible to introduce new chemical pathways. All pharmacology is either enhancing or suppressing one of these pathways. Drug side effects occur when the drug is chemically similar enough to interact with something in a different pathway other the one it is intended to work on. all the chemical pathways are interconnected as well so slowing one down or speeding one up is likely to have a “domino” effect which causes other effects to occur. Furthermore the same chemicals can serve multiple roles depending on the tissue they are present in, taking an analogue of that chemical systemically may cause multiple different effects in different tissues.  [map of the biochemical pathways in your body](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/bio_sim/articles/metabolic_pathways.png)",
    "answer2": "Usually side effects happen because the medications do more in the body than just treat the initial problem. This is because often the medications are made to be processed by the body (ingested a certain way, digested/flow into the bloodstream etc) without causing any problems within the body which cause serious issues but enough for the body to utilise the medication to treat the needs it is created for. This also means that often a medication may treat multiple areas which are not needed by the body for treatment thus to not cause harm must be at a certain dosage, or vice versa. They “under treat” an issue due to the medication being needed for multiple uses/not being able to directly fix the problem at hand alone. This is where side effects come in, normally they are not too bad depending upon the issue but if you are having issues then please speak with your personal health professional. It is also possible to have positive side effects, and In theory this has caused medications to be used for medical treatments wider than their initial intended use, often modified to treat a different issue. But basically the medication cannot directly pin point where the target area may be needed to work so in effect, treats the whole body with such intake - thus causing unrelated bodily side effects elsewhere as it is absorbed as a whole and processed through the entire system, interacting with any and all other molecules it comes into contact with.",

    "question_text": "Does MSG actually naturally occur in foods and is it the same as products like hydrolyzed wheat and yeast extract? I see a lot of articles that defend MSG by saying that it occurs naturally in umami foods and that things like hydrolyzed proteins and yeast extract are just MSG.<br />Is it possible that while MSG is safe, the overzealous arguments aren’t completely true?<br />I thought what occurs naturally and what hydrolyzed protein and yeast extract is actually is glutamic acid, while MSG is monosodium glutamate which is a sodium salt of the acid so they technically aren’t the same.",
    "answer1": "MSG is monosodium glutamate, your body is full of glutamate as it is an amino acid essential for your life, and whenever there is sodium in solution it can and does form MSG. That is why you can't label food as \"no MSG\" or \"MSG free\", it's always \"no MSG added\" because if it has protein at all then it's going to have MSG. MSG, like sodium, is really one of those things that is associated with living things, and it is healthy to have it in your diet. Like sodium, there is such thing as too much. With all that said, there are studies that have shown negative effects of extreme amounts of glutamate (but nobody eats that much), and lots have shown negative effects of MSG, but the MSG negative effects can mostly be explained as too much sodium. As it relates to Chinese food, they traditionally use a lot of soy sauce, which is really soy protein and salt in liquid form, it forms a LOT of MSG, to the point that soy sauce can be considered liquid MSG. Using a lot of soy sauce will add a lot of sodium to your diet, and yes, Chinese food tends to be high in sodium. Those negative effects of Chinese food are really too much sodium, I have gotten headaches from Chinese food, it absolutely was too much sodium. For whatever reason, people seem to think a headache after eating Chinese food, and other negative effects are somehow from the MSG, it's not, it's from the sodium, which technically is \"from MSG\", but you would have had the same effect if your replaced the MSG with table salt.",
    "answer2": "It is possible, that MSG is perfectly safe, in fact we've known about it for years. The original \"idea\" that MSG was bad for you came from a prank letter written, written under a racist pseudonym to a medical journal about how \"[Chinese food makes your tire](https://news.colgate.edu/magazine/2019/02/06/the-strange-case-of-dr-ho-man-kwok/)d\", it was all kind of a good-natured-yet-still-kinda-racist prank in the 1970s.

    "question_text": "Why are engine exhuast valves so much smaller than intake valves? I get that the fuel burns but obviously there is no loss of mass or number of atoms. There is energy released and an increase in pressure, but if anything this would mean the exhuast valves should be bigger to handle the post combustion increase in pressure.",
    "answer1": "When you suck in air through a small opening, there's an upper limit to the pressure difference. You've got one atmosphere of pressure (1 bar) on one side and you can't have more than a perfect vacuum on the other side. 'Sucking harder' won't help and you're limited to 1 bar. When you blow air through a small opening, there's no real upper limit to the pressure difference. In that case 'blowing harder' does help and you can have a pressure difference of 2 or 3 bar. That's why pushing air through the exhaust valves is less of a challenge than sucking air through the intakes valves, and you can trade a bit of exhaust valve area for more intake valve area to improve overall airflow.",
    "answer2": "There is quite clearly an increase in the number of atoms with combustion.  Long chain hydrocarbons are converted mainly to water and carbon dioxide.  But this has nothing to do with the size of the valves. When the exhaust valves open at the end of the combustion stroke, the pressure in the cylinder is high because of the high temperature (causes gases to want to expand), and thus the flow rate out of the exhaust valves will be high.  Said another way, there is a big pressure differential or difference between the pressure in the cylinder and the pressure in the exhaust manifold during the exhaust stroke.  So the exhaust goes out fast.  Like air from a balloon that you are squeezing really hard.  You don't need a big valve for that to get a good flow rate and fully evacuate the cylinder of the exhaust gases.  For the intake stroke, the pressure difference between the cylinder and the intake manifold is small, so the flow rate will be lower.  You need a bigger valve to get all the air into the cylinder by the end of the intake stroke.  This is especially true at high rpm.",

    "answer1": "Growing poppies is usually restricted to commercial, regulated farms, but it’s not outright illegal. Poppy seeds are used in a lot of cuisine, probably most commonly in the West as part of poppy seed cakes and as a topping for bagels (eg. the ubiquitous “everything” bagel usually has poppy seeds). It’s the processing of poppies to morphine/codeine/other opioids that is highly regulated and controlled.",
    "answer2": "It is possible to make morphine through pure synthesis. However this is not a very cheap process and is therefore not used in commercial production. There is however a number of licensed poppy fields around the world. Some countries even allow limited growing of poppies without license as long as you do not extract opium from it. The same poppies used for morphine production is also used for vegitable oil and as orniments. So poppies are grown for other purpuses beyond medical ones.

When I was in high school I thought to myself, \"one day they'll explain me this\".<br />I'm in my second year of college and I'm still told to assume that R is = 0.0821 L*atm/k*mol and no one has taken the time to explain me why. A teaching assistant for my physical chemistry course told me that it's defined as the Avogadro constant times the Boltzmann constant, but this doesn't really help me to understand what R is supposed to represent physically. <br />I guess this is not but rather Explain Like I'm a Chemistry Major.",
    "answer1": "The numerical value of the constant is a result of the unit we use.  If you would use the Rankine scale instead of the kelvins scale it would have another value. Rankine scale absolute temperature the degrees the same as in the Fahrenheit scale instead of Celius scale. The constant would be 9/5 of the one you use. &#x200B; The gas constant is  Avogadro constant times the Boltzmann constant. Avrogados constant is the number of particles in a mol so if you change the calculation to particles instead of mol of particle s the constant is just Boltzmann constant Boltzmann constant is 1.380649×10^−23 J/K We can then quote Wikipedia \"The Boltzmann constant (kB or k) is the proportionality factor that relates the average relative kinetic energy of particles in a gas with the thermodynamic temperature of the gas.\" So it is a scaling factor between the kinetic energy of the particles and the temperature so its value depends on the unit we use. You can define units so it is 1. The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant",
    "answer2": "Gases exhibit some proportional relationships:  - V ~ n: twice the amount of particles will take up twice the volume. - V ~ T: at twice the absolute temperature (measured in Kelvin), the gas takes up twice the volume. - V ~ 1/p: at twice the pressure, the gas will take up half the volume. We can combine these three relationships into V ~ nT/p. So if we know the volume of a given quantity of gas at a given pressure and temperature, we can calculate how it changes when we change any of these properties. The gas constant gives us a base number for that relationship: in the form you stated it, it is the volume of one mol of (ideal) gas at a pressure of 1 atmosphere and a temperature of 1 Kelvin. From this, you can then calculate the volume of *any* amount of ideal gas at *any* pressure and *any* temperature.",

And You’ll receive a cease and desist letter PDQ if you’re infringing on someones registered intellectual property.'' which has no link with the question being asked rather it is only focusing on reverse engineering which is irrelevant thing.\nAnswer B explains the reasons of inability to figure out the contents of things like coca cola syrup. It states ''t is difficult to figure out the contents of Coca Cola syrup because the syrup is a complex mixture of substances. The syrup contains water, sweeteners, colorings, and other ingredients. The exact proportions of these ingredients are proprietary information that Coca Cola does not disclose. Furthermore, the ingredients interact with each other in complex ways, making it difficult to identify all of the components of the syrup. Our current technologies are not able to fully analyze complex mixtures like Coca Cola syrup.'' which explains the complexity of coca cola syrup and inability of current technology in well structured way and clear the concept of the reader.\nSo, Answer B is better choice.",

    "question_text": "When you get a roll of tape, the tape is rolled and stuck on top of itself. So how does it not lose its stickiness then? And how does the stickiness instantly fades away when you stick it to something else and then peel of off? ",
    "answer1": "The roll of tape is sticky because it is coated with an adhesive. The adhesive is a substance that helps two surfaces stay together. The adhesive on the tape is designed to stick to itself and to other surfaces. When you peel the tape off of something, the adhesive is left behind on the surface.",
    "answer2": "There are 2 ways in which things are considered sticky. The primary being chemical and secondary being physical. Physical is a whole other subject as it deals with low level interactions of molecules (IE Gecko Tape). The one most people are familiar with is chemical and is why tape has that very distinct \"tack\" when you touch it.  The tack forms due to a reaction between the glue on the tape and the surface of whatever your trying to stick it too. When a roll of tape is rolled up, the backside has been given great care to ensure its cleaned and may sometimes be coated in a way that slows down the reaction of the glue.  While this has allowed the creation of very powerful adhesives there is many downsides to making tape that adheres stuff chemically. One of the main ones being that once the reactants in the glue have been used up, the tape is nothing more than the backing that was holding the glue in the first place. Tape is considered to have a shelf life for this very reason as common things that drive chemical reactions such as oxygen, heat, and time will cause parts of the tape to break down. This results in the tape prematurely adhering to the backing, the tack being less effective and why that edge on the tape can be hard to find. The glue has reacted with the air and bonded partially to the tape backing",

    "question_text": "What makes diamond so hard ? Please, demystify this for me.",
    "answer1": "Diamonds are hard because of their tight, interlocked atomic structure. Pure diamond is made up of carbon atoms only. Each carbon atom is bonded to four other carbon atoms tetrahedrally, with four sides. The carbon atoms are close together, forming a dense crystal. That structure can be repeated indefinitely, with strong bonds in four directions. Contrast this with graphite, which is also formed from carbon atoms. But in graphite the carbon is formed into layers, with weak forces between layers. This makes graphite soft and slippery, the opposite of diamonds. So it’s not the carbon that makes diamonds hard, but the tight multi-directional bonding between carbon atoms.  That bonding is created by perfectly balanced extreme heat and pressure over millions of years far underground. Geological events like volcanic eruptions then bring the diamonds to the Earth’s surface to be mined. Many diamonds have imperfections or flaws that weaken the structure. But the best are almost perfect crystals, with geometrically regular forms starting at the atomic level.  Humans have learned how to create artificial diamonds in labs. Lab-grown diamonds are chemically and physically no different from natural diamonds. Nearly all industrial grade diamonds are lab-grown.  Gem quality diamonds can also be produced in the lab, and to the naked eye there is no difference from natural diamonds. It takes special instruments to tell the difference. In fact, the way the instruments tell the difference is that artificial diamonds are too perfect, lacking the traces of nitrogen found in natural diamonds. It’s because of their nearly perfect geometry that if you hit them just right you can cut diamonds. But you can’t scratch them except with other diamonds. And diamond grains are used by industry to grind the hardest surfaces with minimal wear to the grinding tool.",

    "question_text": "How is iron black, yet steel light grey? ",
    "answer1": "Grey cast iron is almost black on the outside because of the slag (surface impurities) that cling when they are cast. When you machine it, it is a dark grey.    There is also white cast iron, where iron and carbon form iron carbides, which give is a whitish colour.   Steel can be dark grey to silvery, depending on what is alloyed into it. High Speed Steel is silvery when surface machined, but when it breaks (it is quite brittle) it is also dark grey.",
    "answer2": "Iron and typical iron alloys like steel and cast iron are silvery grey.  Higher carbon alloys like cast iron tend to be lighter coloured than those without much carbon like wrought iron with steel being in the middle. However, iron and its alloys react with oxygen to form  rust.  Iron gets bigger when it becomes rust, which causes the rust to flake off exposing more iron to oxygen so it can rust.  Obviously, we don't want this to happen. We solve this problem by coating it with some sort of protection. Stainless steel contains additives that oxidizes to form a thin, transparent layer of protection. In other cases we coat the iron in a layer of paint or oil.  This is why swords and fancy kitchen knives need to be oiled. We also coat iron with other metals that are more corrosion resistant like zinc, chromium, or nickle. When iron is hot, it it oxidizes more rapidly, but instead of rust it forms hematite which is bluish-black and doesn't flake like rust does.  This can serve as a protective layer against oxidation that causes rust.  The hematite is somewhat fragile so it is normally protected with a layer of oil.  This is known as \"bluing\", particularly when done to firearms, and \"seasoning\" a pan is similar except that the oil is heated to smoke point which causes it to harden into a sort of plastic.  Bluing and seasoning can get quite a bit more complicated. So, iron and its alloys are all light grey with a bit of variation, but most can be covered by black hematite as part of how we protect them from rust.",

    "question_text": "why do some liquids turn into solid when heated? In school we learn that things go from liquid to gas when they reach certain temperature. But things like eggs and other things we cook actually go from liquid to solid. Why/how?",
    "answer1": "Some liquids turn into solid when heated because of a process called phase transition. A phase transition is a change in the physical state of a substance. For example, water can exist in three different states: solid (ice), liquid, and gas (vapor). The phase transition from liquid to solid is called freezing, and the phase transition from solid to liquid is called melting.   Some substances can exist in more than one solid state. For example, carbon can exist as two different solids: graphite and diamond. The phase transition from one solid state to the other is called polymorphism.   Polymorphism is a type of phase transition in which a substance changes from one solid state to another. The two solid states have different arrangements of atoms. The atoms in the two different solid states are held together by different kinds of forces.   The phase transition from liquid to solid is called freezing. The temperature at which a liquid freezes is called the freezing point. The freezing point is the temperature at which the molecules of a substance have enough energy to overcome the forces that are holding them together in the liquid state.   The freezing point of a substance depends on the kind of forces that are holding the molecules together. For example, the freezing point of water is lower than the freezing point of alcohol. This is because the forces that are holding the molecules of water together are weaker than the forces that are holding the molecules of alcohol together.   The phase transition from solid to liquid is called melting. The temperature at which a solid melts is called the melting point. The melting point is the temperature at which the molecules of a substance have enough energy to overcome the forces that are holding them together in the solid state.   The melting point of a substance also depends on the kind of forces that are holding the molecules together. For example, the melting point of diamond is much higher than the melting point of graphite. This is because the forces that are holding the molecules of diamond together are much stronger than the forces that are holding the molecules of graphite together.",
    "answer2": "The answers already given are good, but I think the point where you may be getting confused is that vaporization and melting points (the point where a liquid goes to a gas, or a solid goes to a liquid respectively) only apply to pure substances, though they do generally go cooler = solid and hotter = gas with liquid in between. Eggs are not a pure substance, because as mentioned already they are water plus protein plus salts plus fats etc. which all react a little differently to being heated. A visual representation of a substance’s phase changes (liquid/solid/gas) and the energy required to achieve them is called a phase diagram. It is technically possible to create one for a mixture of multiple different types of molecule, but the concentrations are necessary so you would have to know a lot about that egg to construct one.",
