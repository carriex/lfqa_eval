    "answer1": "There are a number of reasons why the world's richest people cannot simply end hunger or homelessness. First, hunger and homelessness are complex problems that require more than just financial resources to solve. Addressing hunger and homelessness requires a coordinated effort from governments, NGOs, and private individuals and organizations. Second, even if the world's richest people were to donate all of their wealth to ending hunger and homelessness, it would not be enough. The scale of the problem is simply too large. It is estimated that it would cost $30 billion per year to end hunger, and $20 billion per year to end homelessness. Third, the world's richest people are not all philanthropists. Some may be reluctant to donate their wealth to causes like ending hunger and homelessness, because they do not believe that these problems can be solved, or because they do not think it is their responsibility to solve them.",
    "answer2": "He doesn't have enough money, not nearly enough.<br />700M people live is World Bank \"extreme poverty\", less than $2 per day in total income.  This was 2B people in 1990.<br />To be only \"poor\" you need $48 per day in income.  That's $33.6B per day.  Jeff Bezos has $200B, so his entire fortune would be spent in 6 days.",

It starts by stating that \"hunger and homelessness are complex problems\" and \"requires a coordinated effort from governments, NGOs, and private individuals and organizations.\" Likewise, it states, \"the world's richest people are not all philanthropists.\" All of these points are true, and the world's richest people would be unable to solve homelessness even if they wanted to.\n\nAnswer B is correct but only focuses on Jeff Bezos. It states some figures about the number of people living in extreme poverty and how if Jeff Bezos spent his entire net worth on solving poverty, it would be spent in 6 days. While those numbers may or may not be correct, it can be said that the cost of eliminating poverty is beyond the scope of a few wealthy individuals. \n\nThat said, answer A is better written, easy to follow, and provides evidence to support their point. Answer B had some grammatical issues, but it was understandable. \n\n\n",

    "answer1": "It is actually the inflation's side effect.<br />The money worth less than the paper they paint it on. So, they use a higher number.<br />You can see how it begins (again) in Turkish Lira. In 2007, Turkey removed 6 zeroes from the money (ie 10 million TLs become 10 TLs). The $/TL was something like 1.20.<br />Now, $/TL is 8.65. TL loses it's worth. <br />To somewhat counter that, countries issue higher bills. So that the minimum wages can keep up against the inflation and people can afford basic stuff like electricity bills and such.",
    "answer2": "There are a few reasons why some countries might choose to measure their currency in large units. One reason is that it can help to combat inflation. When prices are rising rapidly, it can be difficult to keep track of the value of goods and services if the currency is divided into small units. It can also be difficult to make change for small purchases. If the currency is measured in larger units, it can be easier for people to keep track of the value of goods and services and to make change. Another reason for using large units of currency is that it can make transactions more efficient. For example, if you are buying a car for $1,000, it is more efficient to pay in one $1,000 bill than to pay in ten $100 bills. Finally, large units of currency can also make it easier to track money laundering and other illicit financial activities. If all transactions are conducted in large units of currency, it can be easier to track the flow of money and to identify suspicious activity.",

Basically, the government sells a bond to someone, and after a set amount of time that bond can be redeemed for it's face value, and with interest. The functional value of a bond is built entirely on the value of the government (or company) that backs the bond; if that government is perceived as stable, then the bond retains value, because there's a perception that the bond will be paid when it comes due.<br />In turn, bonds are an investment.

When someone purchases a bond they are essentially lending there money for a specified amount of time. (In bond language it‚Äôs called a term).

    "answer1": "The concept of money is a human invention, not a natural occurrence. Money is an abstract idea that represents a unit of exchange. It is a tool that we use to buy and sell goods and services.<br /><br />The value of money is based on trust. People trust that money will retain its value over time, and that it can be used to purchase goods and services. Money is also a store of value, meaning it can be saved and used in the future.<br /><br />The supply of money is limited. Central banks can print more money, but this can cause inflation, which reduces the value of money. Money is also a scarce resource, which is why we use it as a unit of exchange.<br /><br />There are different types of money, including fiat money, commodity money, and cryptocurrency. Fiat money is money that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver. Commodity money is money that is backed by a physical commodity. Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography to secure its transactions.",

While it is difficult to mention an exact number, there is a reason why a 1,000-square-foot apartment in the city can rent for more than a 2,000-square-foot house in the suburbs. In theory, lowering the rent would likely affect the property value, but it would happen over time. However, the amount is debatable. Answer B is correct about the second part, relating to properties being financed or used as collateral. The owners are trying to avoid having the property value drop too much.\n\nBoth answers do not address why many stores in Manhattan are vacant.

    "answer1": "There are a few reasons why countries with a fiat currency still use tax. First, tax revenue is one of the main ways that governments fund public goods and services. Without tax revenue, governments would have to rely on other sources of funding, which might not be as stable or reliable. Second, tax helps to reduce income inequality by redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor. This is especially important in countries with a large income gap between the rich and the poor. Finally, tax can be used to discourage certain activities that are harmful to the economy or society, such as smoking or pollution.",

    "answer1": "No.<br />Paper money is a tiny fraction of the actual money.  Most money is just numbers in bank accounts.",
    "answer2": "Hyper inflation occurs when people, lenders, foreign companies e.t.c lose confidence in the currency. <br />If I'm a shop owner and I usually sell an apple for 1 coin. However I'm not convinced in a month I'll be able to buy myself enough food/pay rent e.t.c by selling apples for 1 coin. So I raise my prices today to protect myself against currency changes in the future. This of course spirals out of control because everyone starts doing this.<br />Because the value is changing fast, there is no point saving money, so everyone tries to spend all their money at once before it's value is rapidly eroded to zero. Often money will be spent the same day it is earned - and everyone spending every penny every day pushes up prices more and the cycle continues. <br />The only way to fix the issue is to make people trust the currency again. This is usually done by adopting a stable foreign currency or pegging your currency to a foreign currency. (Brazil effectively stopped hyperinflation).",

    "answer1": "A credit or debit card is basically just an easy way to allow a shop to speak to your bank.<br />First you go into the bank, and you either deposit some cash into your account (debit), or you ask the bank nicely to cover you, and promise that you will pay them back at the end of the month (credit).<br />Then you can go shopping. You get to the till with your products, which you now need to pay for, but instead of handing over cash directly, you ask the shop to deal directly with your bank. The shop phones up the bank and asks them to take X amount of money out of your account, then nip over to the shops own bank and give it to them on your behalf, which they do.<br />That is pretty much how a credit or debit card works, just automated with computers...",
    "answer2": "Debit cards are linked to a bank account and whenever you pay using a debit card, the amount is deducted from the bank account on completion of the transaction. So, instead of withdrawing and handing over cash for a purchase, you can swipe the card.<br />Credit cards come with a credit limit and a defined billing cycle (generally monthly). So, you can make purchases using the credit card upto the defined credit limit.

    "question_text": "There is all this talk about global USD shortage despite trillions that were printed in the last 2 years, what gives? ",
    "answer1": "If you go back in time prior to 1990 most of the world's debt is denominated in the local currency of the country where the debt was made.  So if I'm an Indian oil refiner and I want to get a loan to build a new plant, I go to a bank and get a loan that I have to pay back in Indian Rupees.  Similarly, if I'm the government of Vietnam and I want to get a loan to build a new highway, I'll go to a bank and get a loan that needs to be paid back in Vietnamese Dong (no they're not cutting people's penises off, that's what the currency there is called).<br />The problem with this is that most of the loans that are being made to countries outside of the US/EU/Japan are being made by the US/EU/Japan.  Countries outside of that area are also incredibly corrupt.  So what happens when the Vietnamese government can't afford to pay back its loan?  It prints a shitload of Dong and uses the freshly printed currency to pay off its debt.  Because of how many Dong have been printed to satisfy this debt, the value of the Dong collapses and the lender is left with a pile of worthless currency.<br />The solution that lenders in the US/EU/Japan came up with for this problem was to make it so that borrowers outside of those regions have to pay back their loans in dollars.  Now it doesn't matter how much the Vietnamese government devalues its currency - it still has to pay back the same amount of dollars.  <br />Most corporate/national debt is made in the form of 20 or 30 year bonds.  In a 20 year bond you make a small interest payment each year.  Then, at the end of the 20 years, you pay back *the entirety of what you were initially loaned*.  <br />So imagine you take a $100 loan, paid back over 20 years with an interest rate of 1%.  Each year you pay the lender $1 (1% of $100).  Then on year 20 you pay $101 (the original $100 value of the loan plus your final interest payment).  That means that to make your debt payment for year 20, you need 101 times as many dollars as you did to make your payment in year 19.<br />Right now all of the early dollar denominated loans to the third world are starting the hit that point where the borrowers need to make that big, final payment.  That's causing a sudden surge in the need for companies and governments to get dollars.  <br />You can view the China Evergrande situation as being a direct result of this.  Evergrande needs to make the final payment on a lot of its 20/30 year bonds right now.  It has physical assets with a sufficient value to do this (it owns a lot of land and buildings).  The problem is it can't hand the buildings to its creditors because of Chinese government restrictions on foreign land ownership.  It needs to sell the buildings to get dollars to pay off its loans.  But it needs so many dollars so quickly that its hard to find people that have that many dollars at once.",
    "answer2": "There are a few different factors at play here. First, the US dollar is still considered the global reserve currency, meaning that it is used more than any other currency for international transactions. This means that demand for dollars is always high, even when there is a lot of them in circulation.<br /><br />Second, the trillions of dollars that were printed in the last two years were mostly used to bail out banks and other financial institutions. This money never actually made it into the hands of consumers, so it didn't really increase the overall money supply.<br /><br />Lastly, the global economy is still recovering from the last recession, and many countries are still dealing with high levels of debt. This means that there is less demand for USD-denominated assets, and that the dollar is under more pressure than it has been in recent years.",
